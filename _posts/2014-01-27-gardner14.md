title: Bayesian Optimization with Inequality Constraints
abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful framework for minimizing expensive objective
  functions while using very few function evaluations.  It has been successfully applied
  to a variety of problems, including hyperparameter tuning and experimental design.  However,
  this framework has not been extended to the inequality-constrained optimization
  setting, particularly the setting in which evaluating feasibility is just as expensive
  as evaluating the objective.  Here we present constrained Bayesian optimization,
  which places a prior distribution on both the objective and the constraint functions.  We
  evaluate our method on simulated and real data, demonstrating that constrained Bayesian
  optimization can quickly find optimal and feasible points, even when small feasible
  regions cause standard methods to fail.
