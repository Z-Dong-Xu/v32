title: Demystifying Information-Theoretic Clustering
abstract: We propose a novel method for clustering data which is grounded in information-theoretic
  principles and requires no parametric assumptions.  Previous attempts to use information
  theory to define clusters in an assumption-free way are based on maximizing mutual
  information between data and cluster labels. We demonstrate that this intuition
  suffers from a fundamental conceptual flaw that causes clustering performance to
  deteriorate as the amount of data increases. Instead, we return to the axiomatic
  foundations of information theory to define a meaningful clustering measure based
  on the notion of consistency under coarse-graining for finite data.
