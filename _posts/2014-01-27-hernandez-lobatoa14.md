title: Stochastic Inference for Scalable Probabilistic Modeling of Binary Matrices
abstract: Fully observed large binary matrices appear in a wide variety of contexts.
  To model them, probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) methods are an attractive
  solution. However, current batch algorithms for PMF can be inefficient because they
  need to analyze the entire data matrix before producing any parameter updates. We
  derive an efficient stochastic inference algorithm for PMF models of fully observed
  binary matrices. Our method exhibits faster convergence rates than more expensive
  batch approaches and has better predictive performance than scalable alternatives.  The
  proposed method includes new data subsampling strategies which produce large gains
  over standard uniform subsampling. We also address the task  of automatically selecting
  the size of the minibatches of data used by our method. For this, we derive an algorithm
  that adjusts this hyper-parameter online.
