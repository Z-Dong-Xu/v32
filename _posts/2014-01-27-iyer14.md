title: 'Maximum Mean Discrepancy for Class Ratio Estimation: Convergence Bounds and
  Kernel Selection'
abstract: In recent times, many real world applications have emerged that require
  estimates of class ratios in an unlabeled instance collection as opposed to labels
  of individual instances in the collection.  In this paper we investigate the use
  of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) for
  estimating such ratios. First, we theoretically analyze the MMD-based estimates.
  Our analysis establishes that, under some mild conditions, the estimate is statistically
  consistent. More importantly, it provides an upper bound on the error in the estimate
  in terms of intuitive geometric quantities like class separation and data spread.
  Next, we use the insights obtained from the theoretical analysis, to propose a novel
  convex formulation that automatically learns the kernel to be employed in the MMD-based
  estimation. We design an efficient cutting plane algorithm for solving this formulation.  Finally,
  we empirically compare our estimator with several existing methods, and show significantly
  improved performance under varying datasets, class ratios, and training sizes.
