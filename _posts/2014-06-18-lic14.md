title: Bayesian Max-margin Multi-Task Learning with Data Augmentation
abstract: Both max-margin and Bayesian methods have been extensively studied in multi-task
  learning, but have rarely been considered together. We present Bayesian max-margin
  multi-task learning, which conjoins the two schools of methods, thus allowing the
  discriminative max-margin methods to enjoy the great flexibility of Bayesian methods
  on incorporating rich prior information as well as performing nonparametric Bayesian
  feature learning with the latent dimensionality resolved from data. We develop Gibbs
  sampling algorithms by exploring data augmentation to deal with the non-smooth hinge
  loss. For nonparametric models, our algorithms do not need to make mean-field assumptions
  or truncated approximation. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance than
  competitors in both multi-task classification and regression.
