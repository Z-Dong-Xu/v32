title: GEV-Canonical Regression for Accurate Binary Class Probability Estimation when
  One Class is Rare
abstract: We consider the problem of binary class probability estimation (CPE) when
  one class is rare compared to the other. It is well known that standard algorithms
  such as logistic regression do not perform well on this task as they tend to under-estimate
  the probability of the rare class. Common fixes include under-sampling and weighting,
  together with various correction schemes. Recently, Wang & Dey (2010) suggested
  the use of a parametrized family of asymmetric link functions based on the generalized
  extreme value (GEV) distribution, which has been used for modeling rare events in
  statistics. The approach showed promising initial results, but combined with the
  logarithmic CPE loss implicitly used in their work, it results in a non-convex composite
  loss that is difficult to optimize. In this paper, we use tools from the theory
  of proper composite losses (Buja et al, 2005; Reid & Williamson, 2010) to construct
  a canonical underlying CPE loss corresponding to the GEV link, which yields a convex
  proper composite loss that we call the GEV-canonical loss; this loss is tailored
  for the task of CPE when one class is rare, and is easy to minimize using an IRLS-type
  algorithm similar to that used for logistic regression. Our experiments on both
  synthetic and real data demonstrate that the resulting algorithm – which we term
  GEV-canonical regression – outperforms common approaches such as under-sampling
  and weights correction for this problem.
