title: Online Multi-Task Learning for Policy Gradient Methods
abstract: Policy gradient algorithms have shown considerable recent success in solving
  high-dimensional sequential decision making tasks, particularly in robotics.  However,
  these methods often require extensive experience in a domain to achieve high performance.  To
  make agents more sample-efficient, we developed a multi-task policy gradient method
  to learn decision making tasks consecutively, transferring knowledge between tasks
  to accelerate learning.  Our approach provides robust theoretical guarantees, and
  we show empirically that it dramatically accelerates learning on a variety of dynamical
  systems, including an application to quadrotor control.
