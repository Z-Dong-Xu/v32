title: Beta Diffusion Trees
abstract: We define the beta diffusion tree, a random tree structure with a set of
  leaves that defines a collection of overlapping subsets of objects, known as a feature
  allocation. The generative process for the tree is defined in terms of particles
  (representing the objects) diffusing in some continuous space, analogously to the
  Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor diffusion trees (Neal, 2003b; Knowles & Ghahramani, 2011),
  both of which define tree structures over clusters of the particles. With the beta
  diffusion tree, however, multiple copies of a particle may exist and diffuse to
  multiple locations in the continuous space, resulting in (a random number of) possibly
  overlapping clusters of the objects. We demonstrate how to build a hierarchically-clustered
  factor analysis model with the beta diffusion tree and how to perform inference
  over the random tree structures with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We conclude
  with several numerical experiments on missing data problems with data sets of gene
  expression arrays, international development statistics, and intranational socioeconomic
  measurements.
