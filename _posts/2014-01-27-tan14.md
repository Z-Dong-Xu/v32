title: Riemannian Pursuit for Big Matrix Recovery
abstract: Low rank matrix recovery is a fundamental task in many real-world  applications.
  The performance of existing methods, however,   deteriorates significantly when
  applied to ill-conditioned or large-scale matrices.  In this paper, we therefore
  propose an efficient method, called  Riemannian Pursuit (RP), that aims to address
  these two problems  simultaneously. Our method consists of a sequence of fixed-rank  optimization
  problems. Each subproblem, solved by a nonlinear  Riemannian conjugate gradient
  method, aims to correct the solution  in the most important subspace of increasing
  size.   Theoretically, RP converges linearly under mild conditions and  experimental
  results show that it substantially outperforms existing  methods when applied to   large-scale
  and ill-conditioned matrices.
