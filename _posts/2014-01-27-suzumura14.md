title: 'Outlier Path: A Homotopy Algorithm for Robust SVM'
abstract: 'In recent applications with massive but less reliable data (e.g., labels
  obtained by a semi-supervised learning method or crowdsourcing), non-robustness
  of the support vector machine (SVM) often causes considerable performance deterioration.
  Although improving the robustness of SVM has been investigated for long time, robust
  SVM (RSVM) learning still poses two major challenges: obtaining a good (local) solution
  from a non-convex optimization problem and optimally controlling the robustness-efficiency
  trade-off. In this paper, we address these two issues simultaneously in an integrated
  way by introducing a novel homotopy approach to RSVM learning. Based on theoretical
  investigation of the geometry of RSVM solutions, we show that a path of local RSVM
  solutions can be computed efficiently when the influence of outliers is gradually
  suppressed as simulated annealing. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm
  tends to produce better local solutions than the alternative approach based on the
  concave-convex procedure, with the ability of stable and efficient model selection
  for controlling the influence of outliers.'
