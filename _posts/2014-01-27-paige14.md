title: A Compilation Target for Probabilistic Programming Languages
abstract: Forward inference techniques such as sequential Monte Carlo and particle
  Markov chain Monte Carlo for probabilistic programming can be implemented in any
  programming language by creative use of standardized operating system functionality
  including processes, forking, mutexes, and shared memory.   Exploiting this we have
  defined, developed, and tested a probabilistic programming language intermediate
  representation language we call probabilistic C, which itself can be compiled to
  machine code by standard compilers and linked to operating system libraries yielding
  an efficient, scalable, portable probabilistic programming compilation target.  This
  opens up a new hardware and systems research path for optimizing probabilistic programming
  systems.
