title: Optimal Mean Robust Principal Component Analysis
abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques extract low-dimensional structure from
  high-dimensional data and are widespread in machine learning research. In practice,
  due to lacking labeled data, the unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithms
  are more desired. Among them, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the most widely
  used approach. In recent research, several robust PCA algorithms were presented
  to enhance the robustness of PCA model. However, all existing robust PCA methods
  incorrectly center the data using the L2-norm distance to calculate the mean, which
  actually is not the optimal mean due to the L1-norm used in the objective functions.
  It is non-trivial to remove the optimal mean in the robust PCA, because of the sparsity-inducing
  norms used in the robust formulations. In this paper, we propose novel robust PCA
  objective functions with removing optimal mean automatically. We naturally integrate
  the mean calculation into the dimensionality reduction optimization, such that the
  optimal mean can be obtained to enhance the dimensionality reduction. Both theoretical
  analysis and empirical studies demonstrate our new methods can more effectively
  reduce data dimensionality than previous robust PCA methods.
