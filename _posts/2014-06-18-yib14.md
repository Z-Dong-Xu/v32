title: A Single-Pass Algorithm for Efficiently Recovering Sparse Cluster Centers of
  High-dimensional Data
abstract: 'Learning a statistical model for high-dimensional data is an important
  topic in machine learning. Although this problem has been well studied in the supervised
  setting, little is known about its unsupervised counterpart. In this work, we focus
  on the problem of clustering high-dimensional data with sparse centers.  In particular,
  we address the following open question in unsupervised learning: â€œis it possible
  to reliably cluster high-dimensional data when the number of samples is smaller
  than the data dimensionality?" We develop an efficient clustering algorithm that
  is able to estimate sparse cluster centers with a single pass over the data. Our
  theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm is able to accurately recover
  cluster centers with only O(s\log d) number of samples (data points), provided all
  the cluster centers are s-sparse vectors in a d dimensional space. Experimental
  results verify both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed clustering
  algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms on several benchmark datasets.'
