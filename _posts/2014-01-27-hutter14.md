title: An Efficient Approach for Assessing Hyperparameter Importance
abstract: The performance of many machine learning methods depends critically on hyperparameter
  settings. Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable
  successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance
  of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without
  insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions.
  This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging
  random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization.
  We first introduce a novel, linear-time algorithm for computing marginals of random
  forest predictions and then show how to leverage these predictions within a functional
  ANOVA framework, to quantify the importance of both single hyperparameters and of
  interactions between hyperparameters. We conducted experiments with prominent machine
  learning frameworks and state-of-the-art solvers for combinatorial problems. We
  show that our methods provide insight into the relationship between hyperparameter
  settings and performance, and demonstrate that—even in very high-dimensional cases—most
  performance variation is attributable to just a few hyperparameters.
