title: Spectral Regularization for Max-Margin Sequence Tagging
abstract: We frame max-margin learning of latent variable structured prediction models
  as a convex optimization problem, making use of scoring functions computed by input-output
  observable operator models. This learning problem can be expressed as an optimization
  involving a low-rank Hankel matrix that represents the input-output operator model.
  The direct outcome of our work is a new spectral regularization method for max-margin
  structured prediction.  Our experiments confirm that our proposed regularization
  framework leads to an effective way of controlling the capacity of structured prediction
  models.
