title: A Unifying View of Representer Theorems
abstract: It is known that the solution of regularization and interpolation problems
  with Hilbertian penalties can be expressed as a linear combination of the data.
  This very useful property, called the representer theorem, has been widely studied
  and applied to machine learning problems. Analogous optimality conditions have appeared
  in other contexts, notably in matrix regularization.  In this paper we propose a
  unified view, which generalizes the concept of representer theorems and extends
  necessary and sufficient conditions for such theorems to hold. Our main result shows
  a close connection between representer theorems and certain classes of regularization
  penalties, which we call orthomonotone functions.  This result not only subsumes
  previous representer theorems as  special cases but also yields a new class of optimality
  conditions, which goes beyond the classical linear combination of the data.  Moreover,
  orthomonotonicity   provides a useful criterion for testing whether a representer
  theorem  holds for a specific regularization problem.
