title: Gaussian Processes for Bayesian Estimation in Ordinary Differential Equations
abstract: Bayesian parameter estimation in coupled ordinary differential equations
  (ODEs) is challenging due to the high computational cost of numerical integration.
  In gradient matching a separate data model is introduced with the property that
  its gradient can be calculated easily. Parameter estimation is achieved by requiring
  consistency between the gradients computed from the data model and those specified
  by the ODE. We propose a Gaussian process model that directly links state derivative
  information with system observations, simplifying previous approaches and providing
  a natural generative model.
