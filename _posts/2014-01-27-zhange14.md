title: Asynchronous Distributed ADMM for Consensus Optimization
abstract: 'Distributed optimization algorithms are highly attractive for solving big
  data problems. In particular, many machine learning problems can be formulated as
  the global consensus optimization problem, which can then be solved in a distributed
  manner by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. However,
  this suffers from the straggler problem as its updates have to be synchronized.
  In this paper, we propose an asynchronous ADMM algorithm by using two conditions
  to control the asynchrony: partial barrier and bounded delay. The proposed algorithm
  has a simple structure and good convergence guarantees (its convergence rate can
  be reduced to that of its synchronous counterpart). Experiments on different distributed
  ADMM applications show that asynchrony reduces the time on network waiting, and
  achieves faster convergence than its synchronous counterpart in terms of the wall
  clock time.'
