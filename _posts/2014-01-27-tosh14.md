title: Lower Bounds for the Gibbs Sampler over Mixtures of Gaussians
abstract: The mixing time of a Markov chain is the minimum time t necessary for the
  total variation distance between the distribution of the Markov chain’s current
  state X_t and its stationary distribution to fall below some ε> 0. In this paper,
  we present lower bounds for the mixing time of the Gibbs sampler over Gaussian mixture
  models with Dirichlet priors.
