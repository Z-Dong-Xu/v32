title: Concept Drift Detection Through Resampling
abstract: Detecting changes in data-streams is an important part of enhancing learning
  quality in dynamic environments. We devise a procedure for detecting concept drifts
  in data-streams that relies on analyzing the empirical loss of learning algorithms.
  Our method is based on obtaining statistics from the loss distribution by reusing
  the data multiple times via resampling. We present theoretical guarantees for the
  proposed procedure based on the stability of the underlying learning algorithms.
  Experimental results show that the detection method has high recall and precision,
  and performs well in the presence of noise.
