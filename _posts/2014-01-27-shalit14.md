title: Coordinate-descent for learning orthogonal matrices through Givens rotations
abstract: 'Optimizing over the set of orthogonal matrices is a central component in
  problems like sparse-PCA or tensor decomposition. Unfortunately, such optimization
  is hard since simple operations on orthogonal matrices easily break orthogonality,
  and correcting orthogonality usually costs a large amount of computation.  Here
  we propose a framework for optimizing orthogonal matrices, that is the parallel
  of coordinate-descent in Euclidean spaces. It is based on \em Givens-rotations,
  a fast-to-compute operation that affects a small number of entries in the learned
  matrix, and preserves orthogonality.  We show two applications of this approach:
  an algorithm for tensor decompositions used in learning mixture models, and an algorithm
  for sparse-PCA. We study the parameter regime where a  Givens rotation approach
  converges faster and achieves a superior model on a genome-wide brain-wide mRNA
  expression dataset.'
