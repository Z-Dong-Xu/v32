title: 'Structured Low-Rank Matrix Factorization: Optimality, Algorithm, and Applications
  to Image Processing'
abstract: Recently, convex solutions to low-rank matrix factorization problems have
  received increasing attention in machine learning. However, in many applications
  the data can display other structures beyond simply being low-rank. For example,
  images and videos present complex spatio-temporal structures, which are largely
  ignored by current low-rank methods. In this paper we explore a matrix factorization
  technique suitable for large datasets that captures additional structure in the
  factors by using a projective tensor norm, which includes classical image regularizers
  such as total variation and the nuclear norm as particular cases. Although the resulting
  optimization problem is not convex, we show that under certain conditions on the
  factors, any local minimizer for the factors yields a global minimizer for their
  product. Examples in biomedical video segmentation and hyperspectral compressed
  recovery show the advantages of our approach on high-dimensional datasets.
