title: A Consistent Histogram Estimator for Exchangeable Graph Models
abstract: Exchangeable graph models (ExGM) subsume a number of popular network models.
  The mathematical object that characterizes an ExGM is  termed a graphon. Finding
  scalable estimators of graphons, provably consistent, remains an open issue. In
  this paper, we propose a histogram estimator of a graphon that is provably consistent
  and numerically efficient. The proposed estimator is based on a sorting-and-smoothing
  (SAS) algorithm, which first sorts the empirical degree of a graph, then smooths
  the sorted graph using total variation minimization. The consistency of the SAS
  algorithm is proved by leveraging  sparsity concepts from compressed sensing.
