title: Marginal Structured SVM with Hidden Variables
abstract: In this work, we propose the marginal structured SVM (MSSVM) for structured
  prediction with hidden variables. MSSVM properly accounts for the uncertainty of
  hidden variables, and can significantly outperform the previously proposed latent
  structured SVM (LSSVM; Yu & Joachims (2009)) and other state-of-art methods, especially
  when that uncertainty is large. Our method also results in a smoother objective
  function, making gradient-based optimization of MSSVMs converge significantly faster
  than for LSSVMs. We also show that our method consistently outperforms hidden conditional
  random fields (HCRFs; Quattoni et al. (2007)) on both simulated and real-world datasets.
  Furthermore, we propose a unified framework that includes both our and several other
  existing methods as special cases, and provides insights into the comparison of
  different models in practice.
