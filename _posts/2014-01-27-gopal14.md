title: Von Mises-Fisher Clustering Models
abstract: This paper proposes a suite of models for clustering high-dimensional data
  on a unit sphere based on Von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and for discovering
  more intuitive clusters than existing approaches. The proposed models include  a)
  A Bayesian formulation of vMF mixture that enables information sharing among clusters,  b)
  a Hierarchical vMF mixture that provides multi-scale shrinkage and tree structured
  view of the data and c) a Temporal vMF mixture that captures evolution of clusters
  in temporal data.  For posterior inference, we develop fast variational methods  as
  well as collapsed Gibbs sampling techniques for all three models. Our experiments
  on six datasets provide strong empirical support in favour of vMF based clustering
  models over other popular tools such as K-means, Multinomial Mixtures and Latent
  Dirichlet Allocation.
