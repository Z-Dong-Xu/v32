title: Convergence rates for persistence diagram estimation in Topological Data Analysis
abstract: Computational topology  has recently seen an important development toward
  data analysis, giving birth to Topological Data Analysis. Persistent homology appears
  as a fundamental tool in this field. We show that  the use of persistent homology
  can be naturally considered in general statistical frameworks. We establish convergence
  rates of persistence diagrams associated to data randomly sampled from any compact
  metric space to a well defined limit diagram encoding the topological features of
  the support of the measure from which the data have been sampled. Our approach relies
  on a recent and deep stability result for persistence that allows to relate our
  problem to support estimation problems (with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff distance).
  Some numerical experiments are performed in various contexts to illustrate our results.
