title: 'DeCAF: A Deep Convolutional Activation Feature for Generic Visual Recognition'
abstract: We evaluate whether features extracted from the activation of a deep convolutional
  network trained in a fully supervised fashion on a large, fixed set of object recognition
  tasks can be re-purposed to novel generic tasks.  Our generic tasks may differ significantly
  from the originally trained tasks and there may be insufficient labeled or unlabeled
  data to conventionally train or adapt a deep architecture to the new tasks.  We
  investigate and visualize the semantic clustering of deep convolutional features
  with respect to a variety of such tasks, including scene recognition, domain adaptation,
  and fine-grained recognition challenges.  We compare the efficacy of relying on
  various network levels to define a fixed feature, and report novel results that
  significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on several important vision challenges.  We
  are releasing DeCAF, an open-source implementation of these deep convolutional activation
  features, along with all associated network parameters to enable vision researchers
  to be able to conduct experimentation with deep representations across a range of
  visual concept learning paradigms.
