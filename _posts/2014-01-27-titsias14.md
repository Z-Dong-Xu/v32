title: Doubly Stochastic Variational Bayes for non-Conjugate Inference
abstract: We propose a simple and effective variational inference algorithm based
  on stochastic optimisation   that can be widely applied for Bayesian non-conjugate
  inference in continuous parameter spaces. This algorithm is based on stochastic
  approximation and allows for efficient use of gradient information from the model
  joint density. We demonstrate these properties using illustrative examples as well
  as in challenging and diverse Bayesian inference   problems such as variable selection
  in logistic regression and fully   Bayesian inference over kernel hyperparameters
  in Gaussian process regression.
