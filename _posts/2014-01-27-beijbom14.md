title: Guess-Averse Loss Functions For Cost-Sensitive Multiclass Boosting
abstract: Cost-sensitive multiclass classification has recently  acquired significance
  in several applications, through the introduction  of multiclass datasets with well-defined
  misclassification  costs. The design of classification algorithms for this  setting
  is considered. It is argued that the unreliable performance  of current algorithms
  is due to the inability of the underlying  loss functions to enforce a certain fundamental
  underlying property.   This property, denoted guess-aversion, is that  the loss
  should encourage correct classifications over the arbitrary guessing  that ensues
  when all classes are equally scored by the classifier.  While guess-aversion holds
  trivially for binary classification, this is not true in  the multiclass setting.
  A new family of cost-sensitive guess-averse   loss functions is derived, and used
  to design new cost-sensitive multiclass   boosting algorithms, denoted GEL- and
  GLL-MCBoost.  Extensive experiments demonstrate (1) the general importance of   guess-aversion
  and (2) that the GLL loss function outperforms other loss functions for multiclass
  boosting.
