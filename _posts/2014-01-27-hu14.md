title: Multi-period Trading Prediction Markets with Connections to Machine Learning
abstract: We present a new model for prediction markets, in which we use risk measures
  to model agents and introduce a market maker to describe the trading process. This
  specific choice of modelling approach enables us to show that the whole market approaches
  a global objective, despite the fact that the market is designed such that each
  agent only cares about its own goal. In addition, the market dynamic provides a
  sensible algorithm for optimising the global objective. An intimate connection between
  machine learning and our markets is thus established, such that we could 1) analyse
  a market by applying machine learning methods to the global objective; and 2) solve
  machine learning problems by setting up and running certain markets.
