title: Online Learning in Markov Decision Processes with Changing Cost Sequences
abstract: 'In this paper we consider online learning in finite Markov decision processes
  (MDPs) with changing cost sequences under full and bandit-information.  We propose
  to view this problem as an instance of online linear optimization.  We propose two
  methods for this problem: MD^2 (mirror descent with approximate projections) and
  the continuous exponential weights algorithm with Dikin walks.  We provide a rigorous
  complexity analysis of these techniques, while providing near-optimal regret-bounds
  (in particular, we take into account the computational costs of performing approximate
  projections in MD^2).  In the case of full-information feedback, our results complement
  existing ones. In the case of bandit-information feedback we consider the online
  stochastic shortest path problem, a special case of the above MDP problems, and
  manage to improve the existing results by removing the previous restrictive assumption
  that the state-visitation probabilities are uniformly bounded away from zero under
  all policies.'
