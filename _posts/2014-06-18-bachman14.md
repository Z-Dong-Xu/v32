title: Sample-based approximate regularization
abstract: We introduce a method for regularizing linearly parameterized functions
  using general derivative-based penalties, which relies on sampling as well as finite-difference
  approximations of the relevant derivatives. We call this approach sample-based approximate
  regularization (SAR). We provide theoretical guarantees on the fidelity of such
  regularizers, compared to those they approximate, and prove that the approximations
  converge efficiently. We also examine the empirical performance of SAR on several
  datasets.
