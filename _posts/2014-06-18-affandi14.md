title: Learning the Parameters of Determinantal Point Process Kernels
abstract: "Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are  well-suited for modeling repulsion
  and have  proven useful in applications where diversity  is desired. While DPPs
  have many appealing  properties, learning the parameters of a DPP  is difficult,
  as the likelihood is non-convex  and is infeasible to compute in many scenarios.
  Here we propose Bayesian methods for  learning the DPP kernel parameters. These
  methods are applicable in large-scale discrete  and continuous DPP settings, even
  when the  likelihood can only be bounded. We demonstrate  the utility of our DPP
  learning methods  in studying the progression of diabetic neuropathy  based on the
  spatial distribution of  nerve fibers, and in studying human perception  of diversity
  in images."
