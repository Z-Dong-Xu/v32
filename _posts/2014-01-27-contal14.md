title: Gaussian Process Optimization with Mutual Information
abstract: In this paper, we analyze a generic algorithm scheme for sequential global
  optimization using Gaussian processes. The upper bounds we derive on the cumulative
  regret for this generic algorithm improve by an exponential factor the previously
  known bounds for algorithms like GP-UCB. We also introduce the novel Gaussian Process
  Mutual Information algorithm (GP-MI), which significantly improves further these
  upper bounds for the cumulative regret. We confirm the efficiency of this algorithm
  on synthetic and real tasks against the natural competitor, GP-UCB, and also the
  Expected Improvement heuristic.
