title: The Falling Factorial Basis and Its Statistical Applications
abstract: 'We study a novel spline-like basis, which we name the   \it falling factorial
  basis, bearing many similarities to the  classic truncated power basis.  The advantage
  of the falling factorial  basis is that it enables rapid, linear-time computations
  in basis  matrix multiplication and basis matrix inversion.  The falling  factorial
  functions are not actually splines, but are close enough  to splines that they provably
  retain some of the favorable properties  of the latter functions.  We examine their
  application in two  problems: trend filtering over arbitrary input points, and a  higher-order
  variant of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.'
