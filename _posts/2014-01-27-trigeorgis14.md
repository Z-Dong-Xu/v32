title: A Deep Semi-NMF Model for Learning Hidden Representations
abstract: Semi-NMF is a matrix factorization technique that learns a low-dimensional
  representation of a dataset that lends itself to a clustering interpretation. It
  is possible that the mapping between this new representation and our original features
  contains rather complex hierarchical information with implicit lower-level hidden
  attributes, that classical one level clustering methodologies can not interpret.
  In this work we propose a novel model, Deep Semi-NMF, that is able to learn such
  hidden representations that allow themselves to an interpretation of clustering  according
  to different, unknown attributes of a given dataset. We show that by doing so, our
  model is able to learn low-dimensional representations that are better suited for
  clustering, outperforming Semi-NMF, but also other NMF variants.
