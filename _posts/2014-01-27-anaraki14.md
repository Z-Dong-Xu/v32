title: Memory and Computation Efficient PCA via Very Sparse Random Projections
abstract: Algorithms that can efficiently recover principal components in very high-dimensional,
  streaming, and/or distributed data settings have become an important topic in the
  literature. In this paper, we propose an approach to principal component estimation
  that utilizes projections onto very sparse random vectors with Bernoulli-generated
  nonzero entries. Indeed, our approach is simultaneously efficient in memory/storage
  space, efficient in computation, and produces accurate PC estimates, while also
  allowing for rigorous theoretical performance analysis. Moreover, one can tune the
  sparsity of the random vectors deliberately to achieve a desired point on the tradeoffs
  between memory, computation, and accuracy. We rigorously characterize these tradeoffs
  and provide statistical performance guarantees. In addition to these very sparse
  random vectors, our analysis also applies to more general random projections. We
  present experimental results demonstrating that this approach allows for simultaneously
  achieving a substantial reduction of the computational complexity and memory/storage
  space, with little loss in accuracy, particularly for very high-dimensional data.
