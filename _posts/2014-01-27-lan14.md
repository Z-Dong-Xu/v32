title: Spherical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Constrained Target Distributions
abstract: Statistical models with constrained probability distributions are abundant
  in machine learning. Some examples include regression models with norm constraints
  (e.g., Lasso), probit models, many copula models, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation
  (LDA) models. Bayesian inference involving probability distributions confined to
  constrained domains could be quite challenging for commonly used sampling algorithms.
  For such problems, we propose a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that
  provides a general and computationally efficient framework for handling boundary
  conditions. Our method first maps the D-dimensional constrained domain of parameters
  to the unit ball \bf B_0^D(1), then augments it to the D-dimensional sphere \bf
  S^D such that the original boundary corresponds to the equator of \bf S^D. This
  way, our method handles the constraints implicitly by moving freely on sphere generating
  proposals that remain within boundaries when mapped back to the original space.
  To improve the computational efficiency of our algorithm, we divide the dynamics
  into several parts such that the resulting split dynamics has a partial analytical
  solution as a geodesic flow on the sphere. We apply our method to several examples
  including truncated Gaussian, Bayesian Lasso, Bayesian bridge regression, and a
  copula model for identifying synchrony among multiple neurons. Our results show
  that the proposed method can provide a natural and efficient framework for handling
  several types of constraints on target distributions.
