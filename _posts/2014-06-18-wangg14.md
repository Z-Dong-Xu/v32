title: 'Ensemble-Based Tracking: Aggregating Crowdsourced Structured Time Series Data'
abstract: We study the problem of aggregating the contributions of multiple contributors
  in a crowdsourcing setting.  The data involved is in a form not typically considered
  in most crowdsourcing tasks, in that the data is structured and has a temporal dimension.  In
  particular, we study the visual tracking problem in which the unknown data to  be
  estimated is in the form of a sequence of bounding boxes representing the trajectory
  of the target object being tracked.  We propose a factorial hidden Markov model
  (FHMM) for ensemble-based tracking by learning jointly the unknown trajectory of
  the target and the reliability of each tracker in the ensemble.  For efficient online
  inference of the FHMM, we devise a conditional particle filter algorithm by exploiting
  the structure of the joint posterior distribution of the hidden variables.  Using
  the largest open benchmark for visual tracking, we empirically compare two ensemble
  methods constructed from five state-of-the-art trackers with the individual trackers.  The
  promising experimental results provide empirical evidence for our ensemble approach
  to "get the best of all worlds".
