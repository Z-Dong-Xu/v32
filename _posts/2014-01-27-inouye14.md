title: 'Admixture of Poisson MRFs: A Topic Model with Word Dependencies'
abstract: This paper introduces a new topic model based on an admixture of Poisson
  Markov Random Fields (APM), which can model dependencies between words as opposed
  to previous independent topic models such as PLSA (Hofmann, 1999), LDA (Blei et
  al., 2003) or SAM (Reisinger et al., 2010). We propose a class of admixture models
  that generalizes previous topic models and show an equivalence between the conditional
  distribution of LDA and independent Poissonsâ€”suggesting that APM subsumes the modeling
  power of LDA. We present a tractable method for estimating the parameters of an
  APM based on the pseudo log-likelihood and demonstrate the benefits of APM over
  previous models by preliminary qualitative and quantitative experiments.
