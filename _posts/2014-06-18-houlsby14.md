title: Cold-start Active Learning with Robust Ordinal Matrix Factorization
abstract: 'We present a new matrix factorization model for rating data and a corresponding
  active learning strategy to address the cold-start problem. Cold-start is one of
  the most challenging tasks for recommender systems: what to recommend with new users
  or items for which one has little or no data. An approach is to use active learning
  to collect the most useful initial ratings. However, the performance of active learning
  depends strongly upon having accurate estimates of i) the uncertainty in model parameters
  and ii) the intrinsic noisiness of the data. To achieve these estimates we propose
  a heteroskedastic Bayesian model for ordinal matrix factorization. We also present
  a computationally efficient framework for Bayesian active learning with this type
  of complex probabilistic model. This algorithm successfully distinguishes between
  informative and noisy data points. Our model yields state-of-the-art predictive
  performance and, coupled with our active learning strategy, enables us to gain useful
  information in the cold-start setting from the very first active sample.'
