title: High Order Regularization for Semi-Supervised Learning of Structured Output
  Problems
abstract: Semi-supervised learning, which uses unlabeled data to help learn a discriminative
  model, is especially important for structured output problems, as considerably more
  effort is needed to label its multidimensional outputs versus standard single output
  problems. We propose a new max-margin framework for semi-supervised structured output
  learning, that allows the use of powerful discrete optimization algorithms and high
  order regularizers defined directly on model predictions for the unlabeled examples.
  We show that our framework is closely related to Posterior Regularization, and the
  two frameworks optimize special cases of the same objective. The new framework is
  instantiated on two image segmentation tasks, using both a graph regularizer and
  a cardinality regularizer. Experiments also demonstrate that this framework can
  utilize unlabeled data from a different source than the labeled data to significantly
  improve performance while saving labeling effort.
