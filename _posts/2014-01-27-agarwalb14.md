title: 'Taming the Monster: A Fast and Simple Algorithm for Contextual Bandits'
abstract: We present a new algorithm for the contextual bandit learning problem,  where
  the learner repeatedly takes one of K \emphactions in response to the  observed
  \emphcontext, and observes the \emphreward only for that  action. Our method assumes
  access to an oracle for solving fully  supervised cost-sensitive classification
  problems and achieves the  statistically optimal regret guarantee with only \otil(\sqrtKT)  oracle
  calls across all T rounds. By doing so, we obtain the most  practical contextual
  bandit learning algorithm amongst approaches that  work for general policy classes.  We
  conduct a  proof-of-concept experiment which demonstrates the excellent  computational
  and statistical performance of (an online variant of) our  algorithm relative to
  several strong baselines.
