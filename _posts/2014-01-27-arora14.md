title: Provable Bounds for Learning Some Deep Representations
abstract: We give  algorithms with provable guarantees that learn a class of deep
  nets in the generative model view popularized by Hinton and others. Our generative
  model is an n node multilayer neural net that has degree at most n^γ for some γ<
  1 and each edge has a random edge weight in [-1,1]. Our algorithm learns  almost
  all networks in this class with polynomial running time. The sample complexity is
  quadratic or cubic depending upon the details of the model.  The algorithm uses
  layerwise learning. It is based upon a novel idea of observing correlations among
  features and using these to infer the underlying edge structure via a global graph
  recovery procedure. The analysis  of the algorithm reveals interesting structure
  of  neural nets with random edge weights.
