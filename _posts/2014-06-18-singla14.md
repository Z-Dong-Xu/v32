title: Near-Optimally Teaching the Crowd to Classify
abstract: How should we present training examples to learners to teach them classification
  rules? This is a natural problem when training workers for crowdsourcing labeling
  tasks, and is also motivated by challenges in data-driven online education. We propose
  a natural stochastic model of the learners, modeling them as randomly switching
  among hypotheses based on observed feedback. We then develop STRICT, an efficient
  algorithm for selecting examples to teach to workers. Our solution greedily maximizes
  a submodular surrogate objective function in order to select examples to show to
  the learners. We prove that our strategy is competitive with the optimal teaching
  policy. Moreover, for the special case of linear separators, we prove that an exponential
  reduction in error probability can be achieved. Our experiments on simulated workers
  as well as three real image annotation tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk show the
  effectiveness of our teaching algorithm.
