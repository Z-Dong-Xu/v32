title: Learning Theory and Algorithms for revenue optimization in second price auctions
  with reserve
abstract: Second-price auctions with reserve play a critical role for    modern search
  engine and popular online sites since the revenue of   these companies often directly
  depends on the outcome of such   auctions. The choice of the reserve price is the
  main mechanism   through which the auction revenue can be influenced in these   electronic
  markets. We cast the problem of selecting the reserve   price to optimize revenue
  as a learning problem and present a full   theoretical analysis dealing with the
  complex properties of the   corresponding loss function (it is non-convex and discontinuous).
  We further give novel algorithms for solving this problem and report the results
  of encouraging experiments   demonstrating their effectiveness.
