title: Efficient Algorithms for Robust One-bit Compressive Sensing
abstract: While the conventional compressive sensing assumes measurements of infinite
  precision, one-bit compressive sensing considers an extreme setting where each measurement
  is quantized to just a single bit. In this paper, we study the vector recovery problem
  from noisy one-bit measurements, and develop two novel algorithms with formal theoretical
  guarantees. First, we propose a passive algorithm, which is very efficient in the
  sense it only needs to solve a convex optimization problem that has a closed-form
  solution. Despite the apparent simplicity, our theoretical analysis reveals that
  the proposed algorithm can recover both the exactly sparse and the approximately
  sparse vectors. In particular, for a sparse vector with s nonzero elements, the
  sample complexity is O(s \log n/ε^2), where n is the dimensionality and εis the
  recovery error. This result improves significantly over the previously best known
  sample complexity in the noisy setting, which is O(s \log n/ε^4). Second, in the
  case that the noise model is known, we develop an adaptive algorithm based on the
  principle of active learning. The key idea is to solicit the sign information only
  when it cannot be inferred from the current estimator. Compared with the passive
  algorithm, the adaptive one has a lower sample complexity if a high-precision solution
  is desired.
