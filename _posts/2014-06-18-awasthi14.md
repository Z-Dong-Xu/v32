title: Local algorithms for interactive clustering
abstract: We study the design of interactive clustering algorithms  for data sets
  satisfying natural stability  assumptions. Our algorithms start with any initial
  clustering  and only make local changes in each step; both are desirable features
  in many applications.  We show that in this constrained setting one can still design
  provably efficient algorithms that produce  accurate clusterings.  We also show
  that our algorithms perform well on real-world data.
