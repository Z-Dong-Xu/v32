title: A Convergence Rate Analysis for LogitBoost, MART and Their Variant
abstract: LogitBoost, MART and their variant can be viewed as additive tree regression
  using logistic loss and boosting style optimization. We analyze their convergence
  rates based on a new weak learnability formulation. We show that it has O(\frac1T)
  rate when using gradient descent only, while a linear rate is achieved when using
  Newton descent. Moreover, introducing Newton descent when growing the trees, as
  LogitBoost does, leads to a faster linear rate. Empirical results on UCI datasets
  support our analysis.
