title: Pursuit-Evasion Without Regret, with an Application to Trading
abstract: We propose a state-based variant of the classical online learning problem
  of tracking the best expert. In our setting, the actions of the algorithm and experts
  correspond to local moves through a continuous and bounded state space. At each
  step, Nature chooses payoffs as a function of each playerâ€™s current position and
  action. Our model therefore integrates the problem of prediction with expert advice
  with the stateful formalisms of reinforcement learning. Traditional no-regret learning
  approaches no longer apply, but we propose a simple algorithm that provably achieves
  no-regret when the state space is any convex Euclidean region. Our algorithm combines
  techniques from online learning with results from the literature on pursuit-evasion
  games. We describe a quantitative trading application in which the convex region
  captures inventory risk constraints, and local moves limit market impact. Using
  historical market data, we show experimentally that our algorithm has a strong advantage
  over classic no-regret approaches.
