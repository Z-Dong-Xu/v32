title: Automated inference of point of view from user interactions in collective intelligence
  venues
abstract: Empirical evaluation of trust and manipulation in large-scale collective
  intelligence processes is challenging. The datasets involved are too large for thorough
  manual study, and current automated options are limited. We introduce a statistical
  framework which classifies point of view based on user interactions. The framework
  works on Web-scale datasets and is applicable to a wide variety of collective intelligence
  processes. It enables principled study of such issues as manipulation, trustworthiness
  of information, and potential bias. We demonstrate the modelâ€™s effectiveness in
  determining point of view on both synthetic data and a dataset of Wikipedia user
  interactions. We build a combined model of topics and points-of-view on the entire
  history of English Wikipedia, and show how it can be used to find potentially biased
  articles and visualize user interactions at a high level.
