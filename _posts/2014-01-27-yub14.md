title: Circulant Binary Embedding
abstract: Binary embedding of high-dimensional data requires long codes to preserve
  the discriminative power of the input space. Traditional binary coding methods often
  suffer from very high computation and storage costs in such a scenario. To address
  this problem, we propose Circulant Binary Embedding (CBE) which generates binary
  codes by projecting the data with a circulant matrix. The circulant structure enables
  the use of Fast Fourier Transformation to speed up the computation. Compared to
  methods that use unstructured matrices, the proposed method improves the time complexity
  from \mathcalO(d^2) to \mathcalO(d\logd), and the space complexity from \mathcalO(d^2)
  to \mathcalO(d) where d is the input dimensionality. We also propose a novel time-frequency
  alternating optimization to learn data-dependent circulant projections, which alternatively
  minimizes the objective in original and Fourier domains. We show by extensive experiments
  that the proposed approach gives much better performance than the state-of-the-art
  approaches for fixed time, and provides much faster computation with no performance
  degradation for fixed number of bits.
