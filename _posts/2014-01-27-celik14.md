title: Efficient Dimensionality Reduction for High-Dimensional Network Estimation
abstract: We propose module graphical lasso (MGL), an aggressive dimensionality reduction
  and network estimation technique for a high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model
  (GGM). MGL achieves scalability, interpretability and robustness by exploiting the
  modularity property of many real-world networks. Variables are organized into tightly
  coupled modules and a graph structure is estimated to determine the conditional
  independencies among modules. MGL iteratively learns the module assignment of variables,
  the latent variables, each corresponding to a module, and the parameters of the
  GGM of the latent variables. In synthetic data experiments, MGL outperforms the
  standard graphical lasso and three other methods that incorporate latent variables
  into GGMs. When applied to gene expression data from ovarian cancer, MGL outperforms
  standard clustering algorithms in identifying functionally coherent gene sets and
  predicting survival time of patients. The learned modules and their dependencies
  provide novel insights into cancer biology as well as identifying possible novel
  drug targets.
