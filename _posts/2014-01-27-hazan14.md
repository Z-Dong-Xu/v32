title: Hard-Margin Active Linear Regression
abstract: We consider the fundamental problem of linear regression in which the designer
  can actively choose observations.   This model naturally captures various experiment
  design settings in medical experiments, ad placement problems and more. Whereas
  previous literature addresses the soft-margin or mean-square-error variants of the
  problem, we consider a natural machine learning hard-margin criterion. In this setting,
  we show that active learning admits significantly better sample complexity bounds
  than the passive learning counterpart, and give  efficient algorithms that attain
  near-optimal  bounds.
