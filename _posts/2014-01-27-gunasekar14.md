title: Exponential Family Matrix Completion under Structural Constraints
abstract: We consider the matrix completion problem of recovering a structured matrix
  from noisy and partial measurements. Recent works have proposed tractable estimators
  with strong statistical guarantees for the case where the underlying matrix is low–rank,
  and the measurements consist of a subset, either of the exact individual entries,  or
  of the entries perturbed by additive Gaussian noise, which is thus implicitly suited
  for thin–tailed continuous data. Arguably, common applications of matrix completion
  require estimators for (a) heterogeneous data–types, such as skewed–continuous,
  count, binary, etc., (b) for heterogeneous noise models (beyond Gaussian), which
  capture varied uncertainty in the measurements, and (c) heterogeneous structural
  constraints beyond low–rank, such as block–sparsity, or a superposition structure
  of low–rank plus elementwise sparseness, among others. In this paper, we provide
  a vastly unified framework for generalized matrix completion by considering a  matrix
  completion setting wherein the matrix entries are sampled from any member of the
  rich family of \textitexponential family distributions; and impose general structural
  constraints on the underlying matrix, as captured by a general regularizer \mathcalR(.).
  We propose a simple convex regularized M–estimator for the generalized framework,
  and provide a unified and novel statistical analysis for this general class of estimators.
  We finally corroborate our theoretical results on simulated datasets.
