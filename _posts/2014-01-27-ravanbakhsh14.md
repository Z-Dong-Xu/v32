title: Min-Max Problems on Factor Graphs
abstract: We study the min-max problem in factor graphs, which seeks the assignment
  that minimizes the maximum value over all factors. We reduce this problem to both
  min-sum and sum-product inference, and focus on the later. This approach reduces
  the min-max inference problem to a sequence of constraint satisfaction problems
  (CSPs) which allows us to sample from a uniform distribution over the set of solutions.
  We demonstrate how this scheme provides a message passing solution to several NP-hard
  combinatorial problems, such as min-max clustering (a.k.a. K-clustering), the asymmetric
  K-center problem, K-packing and the bottleneck traveling salesman problem. Furthermore
  we theoretically relate the min-max reductions to several NP hard decision problems,
  such as clique cover, set cover, maximum clique and Hamiltonian cycle, therefore
  also providing message passing solutions for these problems. Experimental results
  suggest that message passing often provides near optimal min-max solutions for moderate
  size instances.
