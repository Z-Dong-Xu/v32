title: Efficient Learning of Mahalanobis Metrics for Ranking
abstract: We develop an efficient algorithm to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric
  by directly optimizing a ranking loss.  Our approach focuses on optimizing the top
  of the induced rankings, which is desirable in tasks such as visualization and nearest-neighbor
  retrieval.  We further develop and justify a simple technique to reduce training
  time significantly with minimal impact on performance.   Our proposed method significantly
  outperforms alternative methods on several real-world tasks, and can scale to large
  and high-dimensional data.
