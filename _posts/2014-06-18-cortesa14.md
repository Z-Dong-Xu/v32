title: Ensemble Methods for Structured Prediction
abstract: We present a series of learning algorithms and theoretical guarantees for
  designing accurate ensembles of structured prediction tasks. This includes several
  randomized and deterministic algorithms devised by converting on-line learning algorithms
  to batch ones, and a boosting-style algorithm applicable in the context of structured
  prediction with a large number of labels. We give a detailed study of all these
  algorithms, including the description of new on-line-to-batch conversions and learning
  guarantees. We also report the results of extensive experiments with these algorithms
  in several structured prediction tasks.
