title: Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent with Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
abstract: We propose a new stochastic dual coordinate ascent technique  that can be
  applied to a wide range of regularized learning problems. Our method is based on  alternating
  direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to deal with complex regularization functions
  such as structured regularizations. Although the original ADMM is a batch method,  the
  proposed method offers a stochastic update rule where each iteration requires only
  one or few sample observations. Moreover, our method can naturally afford mini-batch
  update and it gives speed up of convergence. We show that, under mild assumptions,
  our method converges exponentially. The numerical experiments show that our method
  actually performs efficiently.
