title: Clustering in the Presence of Background Noise
abstract: We address the problem of noise management in clustering algorithms. Namely,
  issues that arise when on top of some cluster structure the data also contains an
  unstructured set of points. We consider how clustering algorithms can be “robustified"
  so that they recover the cluster structure in spite of the unstructured part of
  the input. We introduce some quantitative measures of such robustness that take
  into account the strength of the embedded cluster structure as well was the mildness
  of the noise subset. We propose a simple and efficient method to turn any centroid-based
  clustering algorithm into a noise-robust one, and prove robustness guarantees for
  our method with respect to these measures. We also prove that more straightforward
  ways of “robustifying” clustering algorithms fail to achieve similar guarantees.
