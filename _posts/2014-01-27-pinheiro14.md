title: Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Scene Labeling
abstract: The goal of the scene labeling task is to assign a class label to each pixel
  in an image.  To ensure a good visual coherence and a high class accuracy, it is
  essential for a model to capture long range  pixel) label dependencies in images.
  In a feed-forward architecture, this can be achieved simply by considering a sufficiently
  large input context patch, around each pixel to be labeled.  We propose an approach
  that consists of a recurrent convolutional neural network which allows us to consider
  a large input context while limiting the capacity of the model. Contrary to most
  standard approaches, our method does not rely on any segmentation technique nor
  any task-specific features. The system is trained in an end-to-end manner over raw
  pixels, and models complex spatial dependencies with low inference cost. As the
  context size increases with the built-in recurrence, the system identifies and corrects
  its own errors. Our approach yields state-of-the-art performance on both the Stanford
  Background Dataset and the SIFT Flow Dataset, while remaining very fast at test
  time.
