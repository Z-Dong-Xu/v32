title: 'Robust RegBayes: Selectively Incorporating First-Order Logic Domain Knowledge
  into Bayesian Models'
abstract: Much research in Bayesian modeling has been done to elicit a prior distribution
  that incorporates domain knowledge. We present a novel and more direct approach
  by imposing First-Order Logic (FOL) rules on the posterior distribution. Our approach
  unifies FOL and Bayesian modeling under the regularized Bayesian framework. In addition,
  our approach automatically estimates the uncertainty of FOL rules when they are
  produced by humans, so that reliable rules are incorporated while unreliable ones
  are ignored. We apply our approach to latent topic modeling tasks and demonstrate
  that by combining FOL knowledge and Bayesian modeling, we both improve the task
  performance and discover more structured latent representations in unsupervised
  and supervised learning.
