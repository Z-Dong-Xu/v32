title: Deep Supervised and Convolutional Generative Stochastic Network for Protein
  Secondary Structure Prediction
abstract: Predicting protein secondary structure is a fundamental problem in protein
  structure prediction. Here we present a new supervised generative stochastic network
  (GSN) based method to predict local secondary structure with deep hierarchical representations.
  GSN is a recently proposed deep learning technique (Bengio & Thibodeau-Laufer, 2013)
  to globally train deep generative model. We present the supervised extension of
  GSN, which learns a Markov chain to sample from a conditional distribution, and
  applied it to protein structure prediction. To scale the model to full-sized, high-dimensional
  data, like protein sequences with hundreds of amino-acids, we introduce a convolutional
  architecture, which allows efficient learning across multiple layers of hierarchical
  representations. Our architecture uniquely focuses on predicting structured low-level
  labels informed with both low and high-level representations learned by the model.
  In our application this corresponds to labeling the secondary structure state of
  each amino-acid residue. We trained and tested the model on separate sets of non-homologous
  proteins sharing less than 30% sequence identity. Our model achieves 66.4% Q8 accuracy
  on the CB513 dataset, better than the previously reported best performance 64.9%
  (Wang et al., 2011) for this challenging secondary structure prediction problem.
