title: Influence Function Learning in Information Diffusion Networks
abstract: 'Can we learn the influence of a set of people in a social network from
  cascades of information diffusion? This question is often addressed by a two-stage
  approach: first learn a diffusion model, and then calculate the influence based
  on the learned model. Thus, the success of this approach relies heavily on the correctness
  of the diffusion model which is hard to verify for real world data. In this paper,
  we exploit the insight that the influence functions in many diffusion models are
  coverage functions, and propose a novel parameterization of such functions using
  a convex combination of random basis functions. Moreover, we propose an efficient
  maximum likelihood based algorithm to learn such functions directly from cascade
  data, and hence bypass the need to specify a particular diffusion model in advance.
  We provide both theoretical and empirical analysis for our approach, showing that
  the proposed approach can provably learn the influence function with low sample
  complexity, be robust to the unknown diffusion models, and significantly outperform
  existing approaches in both synthetic and real world data.'
