title: Safe Screening with Variational Inequalities and Its Application to Lasso
abstract: Sparse learning techniques have been routinely used for feature selection
  as the resulting model usually has a small number of non-zero entries.  Safe screening,
  which eliminates the features that are guaranteed to have zero coefficients for
  a certain value of the regularization parameter, is a technique for improving the
  computational efficiency. Safe screening is gaining increasing attention since 1)
  solving sparse learning formulations usually has a high computational cost especially
  when the number of features is large and 2) one needs to try several regularization
  parameters to select a suitable model. In this paper, we propose an approach called
  â€œSasvi" (Safe screening with variational inequalities). Sasvi makes use of the variational
  inequality that provides the sufficient and necessary optimality condition for the
  dual problem. Several existing approaches for Lasso screening can be casted as relaxed
  versions of the proposed Sasvi, thus Sasvi provides a stronger safe screening rule.
  We further study the monotone properties of Sasvi for Lasso, based on which a sure
  removal regularization parameter can be identified for each feature. Experimental
  results on both synthetic and real data sets are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed Sasvi for Lasso screening.
