title: Model-Based Relational RL When Object Existence is Partially Observable
abstract: We consider learning and planning in relational MDPs when object existence
  is uncertain and new objects may appear or disappear depending on previous actions
  or properties of other objects. Optimal policies actively need to discover  objects
  to achieve a goal; planning in such domains in general amounts to a POMDP problem,
  where the belief is about the existence and properties of potential not-yet-discovered
  objects. We propose a computationally efficient extension of model-based relational
  RL methods that approximates these beliefs using discrete uncertainty predicates.
  In this formulation the belief update  is learned using probabilistic rules and
  planning in the approximated belief space can be achieved  using an extension of
  existing planners. We prove that the learned belief update rules encode an approximation
  of the exact belief updates of a POMDP formulation and demonstrate experimentally
  that the proposed approach successfully  learns a set of relational rules appropriate
  to solve  such problems.
