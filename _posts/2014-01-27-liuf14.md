title: Gaussian Approximation of Collective Graphical Models
abstract: The Collective Graphical Model (CGM) models a population of  independent
  and identically distributed individuals when only  collective statistics (i.e.,
  counts of individuals) are   observed. Exact inference in CGMs is intractable, and
  previous work  has explored Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and MAP approximations  for
  learning and inference. This paper studies Gaussian approximations  to the CGM.
  As the population grows large, we show that the CGM   distribution converges to
  a multivariate Gaussian distribution (GCGM)  that maintains the conditional independence
  properties of the original  CGM.  If the observations are exact marginals of the
  CGM or marginals  that are corrupted by Gaussian noise, inference in the GCGM  approximation
  can be computed efficiently in closed form. If the   observations follow a different
  noise model (e.g., Poisson), then  expectation propagation provides efficient and
  accurate approximate  inference. The accuracy and speed of GCGM inference is compared
  to the   MCMC and MAP methods on a simulated bird migration problem. The GCGM  matches
  or exceeds the accuracy of the MAP method while being significantly  faster.
