title: Saddle Points and Accelerated Perceptron Algorithms
abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of finding a linear (binary) classifier
  or providing a near-infeasibility certificate if there is none. We bring a new perspective
  to addressing these two problems simultaneously in a single efficient process, by
  investigating a related Bilinear Saddle Point Problem (BSPP). More specifically,
  we show that a BSPP-based approach provides either a linear classifier or an ε-infeasibility
  certificate. We show that the accelerated primal-dual algorithm, Mirror Prox, can
  be used for this purpose and achieves the best known convergence rate of O(\sqrt\log
  n\overρ(A)) (O(\sqrt\log n\overε)), which is \emphalmost independent of the problem
  size, n. Our framework also solves kernelized and conic versions of the problem,
  with the same rate of convergence. We support our theoretical findings with an empirical
  study on synthetic and real data, highlighting the efficiency and numerical stability
  of our algorithms, especially on  large-scale instances.
