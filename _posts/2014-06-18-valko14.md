title: Spectral Bandits for Smooth Graph Functions
abstract: Smooth functions on graphs have wide applications in manifold and semi-supervised
  learning. In this paper, we study a bandit problem where the payoffs of arms are
  smooth on a graph. This framework is suitable for solving online learning problems
  that involve graphs, such as content-based recommendation. In this problem, each
  item we can recommend is a node and its expected rating is similar to its neighbors.
  The goal is to recommend items that have high expected ratings. We aim for the algorithms
  where the cumulative regret with respect to the optimal policy would not scale poorly
  with the number of nodes. In particular, we introduce the notion of an effective
  dimension, which is small in real-world graphs, and propose two algorithms for solving
  our problem that scale linearly and sublinearly in this dimension. Our experiments
  on real-world content recommendation problem show that a good estimator of user
  preferences for thousands of items can be learned from just tens of nodes evaluations.
