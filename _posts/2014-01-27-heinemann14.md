title: Inferning with High Girth Graphical Models
abstract: Unsupervised learning of graphical models is an important task in many domains.
  Although maximum likelihood learning is computationally hard, there do exist consistent
  learning algorithms (e.g., psuedo-likelihood and its variants). However, inference
  in the learned models is still hard, and thus they are not directly usable. In other
  words, given a probabilistic query they are not guaranteed to provide an answer
  that is close to the true one.   In the current paper, we provide a learning algorithm
  that is guaranteed to provide approximately correct probabilistic inference. We
  focus on a particular class of models, namely high girth graphs in the correlation
  decay regime. It is well known that approximate inference (e.g, using loopy BP)
  in such models yields marginals that are close to the true ones. Motivated by this,
  we propose an algorithm that always returns models of this type, and hence in the
  models it returns inference is approximately correct. We derive finite sample results
  guaranteeing that beyond a certain sample size, the resulting models will answer
  probabilistic queries with a high level of accuracy.   Results on synthetic data
  show that the models we learn indeed outperform those obtained by other algorithms,
  which do not return high girth graphs.
