title: Agnostic Bayesian Learning of Ensembles
abstract: We propose a method for producing ensembles of predictors based on holdout
  estimations of their generalization performances. This approach uses a prior directly
  on the performance of predictors taken from a finite set of candidates and attempts
  to infer which one is best. Using Bayesian inference, we can thus obtain a posterior
  that represents our uncertainty about that choice and construct a weighted ensemble
  of predictors accordingly. This approach has the advantage of not requiring that
  the predictors be probabilistic themselves, can deal with arbitrary measures of
  performance and does not assume that the data was actually generated from any of
  the predictors in the ensemble. Since the problem of finding the best (as opposed
  to the true) predictor among a class is known as agnostic PAC-learning, we refer
  to our method as agnostic Bayesian learning. We also propose a method to address
  the case where the performance estimate is obtained from k-fold cross validation.
  While being efficient and easily adjustable to any loss function, our experiments
  confirm that the agnostic Bayes approach is state of the art compared to common
  baselines such as model selection based on k-fold cross-validation or a linear combination
  of predictor outputs.
