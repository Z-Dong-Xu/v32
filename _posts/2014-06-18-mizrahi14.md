title: Linear and Parallel Learning of Markov Random Fields
abstract: We introduce a new embarrassingly parallel parameter learning algorithm
  for Markov random fields which is efficient for a large class of practical models.  Our
  algorithm parallelizes naturally over cliques and, for graphs of bounded degree,
  its complexity is linear in the number of cliques. Unlike its competitors, our algorithm
  is fully parallel and for log-linear models it is also data efficient, requiring
  only the local sufficient statistics of the data to estimate parameters.
