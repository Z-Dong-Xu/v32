title: Rectangular Tiling Process
abstract: 'This paper proposes a novel stochastic process that represents the arbitrary
  rectangular partitioning of an infinite-dimensional matrix as the conditional projective
  limit. Rectangular partitioning is used in relational data analysis, and is classified
  into three types: regular grid, hierarchical, and arbitrary. Conventionally, a variety
  of probabilistic models have been advanced for the first two, including the product
  of Chinese restaurant processes and the Mondrian process. However, existing models
  for arbitrary partitioning are too complicated to permit the analysis of the statistical
  behaviors of models, which places very severe capability limits on relational data
  analysis. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic model of arbitrary partitioning
  called the rectangular tiling process (RTP). Our model has a sound mathematical
  base in projective systems and infinite extension of conditional probabilities,
  and is capable of representing partitions of infinite elements as found in ordinary
  Bayesian nonparametric models.'
