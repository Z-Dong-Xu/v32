title: Multiple Testing under Dependence via Semiparametric Graphical Models
abstract: It has been shown that graphical models can be used to leverage the dependence
  in large-scale multiple testing problems with significantly improved performance
  (Sun & Cai, 2009; Liu et al., 2012). These graphical models are fully parametric
  and require that we know the parameterization of f1, the density function of the
  test statistic under the alternative hypothesis. However in practice, f1 is often
  heterogeneous, and cannot be estimated with a simple parametric distribution. We
  propose a novel semiparametric approach for multiple testing under dependence, which
  estimates f1 adaptively. This semiparametric approach exactly generalizes the local
  FDR procedure (Efron et al., 2001) and connects with the BH procedure (Benjamini
  & Hochberg, 1995). A variety of simulations show that our semiparametric approach
  outperforms classical procedures which assume independence and the parametric approaches
  which capture dependence.
