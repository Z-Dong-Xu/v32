title: Active Transfer Learning under Model Shift
abstract: Transfer learning algorithms are used when one has sufficient training data
  for one supervised learning task (the source task) but only very limited training
  data for a second task (the target task) that is similar but not identical to the
  first.  These algorithms use varying assumptions about the similarity between the
  tasks to carry information from the source to the target task.  Common assumptions
  are that only certain specific marginal or conditional distributions have changed
  while all else remains the same. Alternatively, if one has only the target task,
  but also has the ability to choose a limited amount of additional training data
  to collect, then active learning algorithms are used to make choices which will
  most improve performance on the target task. These algorithms may be combined into
  active transfer learning, but previous efforts have had to apply the two methods
  in sequence or use restrictive transfer assumptions.    We propose two transfer
  learning algorithms that allow changes in all marginal and conditional distributions
  but assume the changes are smooth in order to achieve transfer between the tasks.  We
  then propose an active learning algorithm for the second method that yields a combined
  active transfer learning algorithm.  We demonstrate the algorithms on synthetic
  functions and a real-world task on estimating the yield of vineyards from images
  of the grapes.
