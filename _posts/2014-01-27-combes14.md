title: 'Unimodal Bandits: Regret Lower Bounds and Optimal Algorithms'
abstract: We consider stochastic multi-armed bandits where the expected reward is
  a unimodal function over partially ordered arms. This important class of problems
  has been recently investigated in (Cope 2009, Yu 2011). The set of arms is either
  discrete, in which case arms correspond to the vertices of a finite graph whose
  structure represents similarity in rewards, or continuous, in which case arms belong
  to a bounded interval. For discrete unimodal bandits, we derive asymptotic lower
  bounds for the regret achieved under any algorithm, and propose OSUB, an algorithm
  whose regret matches this lower bound. Our algorithm optimally exploits the unimodal
  structure of the problem, and surprisingly, its asymptotic regret does not depend
  on the number of arms. We also provide a regret upper bound for OSUB in non-stationary
  environments where the expected rewards smoothly evolve over time. The analytical
  results are supported by numerical experiments showing that OSUB performs significantly
  better than the state-of-the-art algorithms. For continuous sets of arms, we provide
  a brief discussion. We show that combining an appropriate discretization of the
  set of arms with the UCB algorithm yields an order-optimal regret, and in practice,
  outperforms recently proposed algorithms designed to exploit the unimodal structure.
