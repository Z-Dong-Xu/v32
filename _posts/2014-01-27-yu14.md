title: Large-scale Multi-label Learning with Missing Labels
abstract: 'The multi-label classification problem has generated significant interest
  in recent years. However, existing approaches do not adequately address two key
  challenges: (a) scaling up to problems with a large number (say millions) of labels,
  and (b) handling data with missing labels. In this paper, we directly address both
  these problems by studying the multi-label problem in a generic empirical risk minimization
  (ERM) framework. Our framework, despite being simple, is surprisingly able to encompass
  several recent label-compression based methods which can be derived as special cases
  of our method. To optimize the ERM problem, we develop techniques that exploit the
  structure of specific loss functions - such as the squared loss function - to obtain
  efficient algorithms. We further show that our learning framework admits excess
  risk bounds even in the presence of missing labels. Our bounds are tight and demonstrate
  better generalization performance for low-rank promoting trace-norm regularization
  when compared to (rank insensitive) Frobenius norm regularization. Finally, we present
  extensive empirical results on a variety of benchmark datasets and show that our
  methods perform significantly better than existing label compression based methods
  and can scale up to very large datasets such as a Wikipedia dataset that has more
  than 200,000 labels.'
