title: Asymptotically consistent estimation of the number of change points in highly
  dependent time series
abstract: 'The problem of change point estimation is considered in a general framework
  where the  data are generated by arbitrary unknown stationary ergodic process distributions.
  This means that the data may have  long-range dependencies of an arbitrary form.
  In this context the consistent estimation of the number of change points is provably
  impossible. A formulation is proposed which overcomes this obstacle:   it is possible
  to find the correct number of change points at the  expense of introducing the additional
  constraint that the correct number of  process distributions that generate the data
  is provided. This additional parameter has a natural interpretation  in many real-world
  applications.  It turns out that in this formulation change point estimation can
  be reduced to time series clustering. Based on this reduction, an algorithm is proposed
  that finds the number of change points and locates the changes.  This algorithm
  is shown to be asymptotically consistent.  The theoretical results are complemented
  with empirical evaluations.'
