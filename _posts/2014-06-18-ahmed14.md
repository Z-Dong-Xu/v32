title: 'Hierarchical Conditional Random Fields for Outlier Detection: An Application
  to Detecting Epileptogenic Cortical Malformations'
abstract: We cast the problem of detecting and isolating regions of abnormal cortical
  tissue in the MRIs of epilepsy patients in an image segmentation framework. Employing
  a multiscale approach we divide the surface images into segments of different sizes
  and then classify each segment as being an outlier, by comparing it to the same
  region across controls. The final classification is obtained by fusing the outlier
  probabilities obtained at multiple scales using a tree-structured hierarchical conditional
  random field (HCRF). The proposed method correctly detects abnormal regions in 90%
  of patients whose abnormality was detected via routine visual inspection of their
  clinical MRI. More importantly, it detects abnormalities in 80% of patients whose
  abnormality escaped visual inspection by expert radiologists.
