title: Maximum Margin Multiclass Nearest Neighbors
abstract: 'We develop a general framework for margin-based multicategory classification
  in metric spaces. The basic work-horse is a margin-regularized version of the nearest-neighbor
  classifier. We prove generalization bounds that match the state of the art in sample
  size n and significantly improve the dependence on the number of classes k. Our
  point of departure is a nearly Bayes-optimal finite-sample risk bound independent
  of k. Although k-free, this bound is unregularized and non-adaptive, which motivates
  our main result: Rademacher and scale-sensitive margin bounds with a logarithmic
  dependence on k. As the best previous risk estimates  in this setting were of order
  \sqrt k, our bound is exponentially sharper. From the algorithmic standpoint, in
  doubling metric spaces our classifier may be trained on n examples in  O(n^2\log
  n) time and evaluated on new points in O(\log n) time.'
