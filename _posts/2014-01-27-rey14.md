title: Sparse meta-Gaussian information bottleneck
abstract: We present a new sparse compression technique based on the information  bottleneck
  (IB) principle, which takes into account side information. This is achieved by introducing
  a sparse variant of IB which preserves the information in only a few selected dimensions
  of the original data through compression. By assuming a Gaussian copula we can capture
  arbitrary non-Gaussian margins, continuous or discrete. We apply our model to select
  a sparse number of biomarkers relevant to the evolution of malignant melanoma and
  show that our sparse selection  provides reliable predictors.
