title: Fast Allocation of Gaussian Process Experts
abstract: We propose a scalable nonparametric Bayesian regression model based on a
  mixture of Gaussian process (GP) experts  and the inducing points formalism underpinning
  sparse GP approximations. Each expert is augmented with a set of inducing points,
  and the allocation of data points to experts is defined probabilistically based
  on their proximity to the experts. This allocation mechanism enables a fast variational
  inference procedure for learning of the inducing inputs and hyperparameters of the
  experts. When using K experts, our method can  run K^2 times faster and use K^2
  times less memory than popular sparse methods such as the FITC approximation. Furthermore,
  it is easy to parallelize and handles non-stationarity  straightforwardly. Our experiments
  show that on medium-sized datasets (of around 10^4 training points) it  trains up
  to 5 times faster than FITC while achieving comparable accuracy. On a large dataset  of
  10^5 training points, our method significantly outperforms six  competitive baselines
  while requiring only a few hours of training.
