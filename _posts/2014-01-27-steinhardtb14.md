title: 'Adaptivity and Optimism: An Improved Exponentiated Gradient Algorithm'
abstract: We present an adaptive variant of the exponentiated gradient algorithm.
  Leveraging the optimistic learning framework of Rakhlin & Sridharan (2012), we obtain
  regret bounds that in the learning from experts setting depend on the variance and
  path length of the best expert, improving on results by Hazan & Kale (2008) and
  Chiang et al. (2012), and resolving an open problem posed by Kale (2012). Our techniques
  naturally extend to matrix-valued loss functions, where we present an adaptive matrix
  exponentiated gradient algorithm. To obtain the optimal regret bound in the matrix
  case, we generalize the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader algorithm to vector-valued
  payoffs, which may be of independent interest.
