title: Efficient Approximation of Cross-Validation for Kernel Methods using Bouligand
  Influence Function
abstract: Model selection is one of the key issues both in recent research and application
  of kernel methods. Cross-validation is a commonly employed and widely accepted model
  selection criterion. However, it requires multiple times of training the algorithm
  under consideration, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we present
  a novel strategy for approximating the cross-validation based on the Bouligand influence
  function (BIF), which only requires the solution of the algorithm once. The BIF
  measures the impact of an infinitesimal small amount of contamination of the original
  distribution. We first establish the link between the concept of BIF and the concept
  of cross-validation. The BIF is related to the first order term of a Taylor expansion.
  Then, we calculate the BIF and higher order BIFs, and apply these theoretical results
  to approximate the cross-validation error in practice. Experimental results demonstrate
  that our approximate cross-validation criterion is sound and efficient.
