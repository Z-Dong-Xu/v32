title: Filtering with Abstract Particles
abstract: Using particles, beam search and sequential Monte Carlo can approximate
  distributions in an extremely flexible manner. However, they can suffer from sparsity
  and inadequate coverage on large state spaces. We present a new filtering method
  that addresses this issue  by using “abstract particles” that each represent an
  entire region of the state space. These abstract particles are combined into a hierarchical
  decomposition, yielding a  representation that is both compact and flexible. Empirically,
  our method outperforms beam search and sequential Monte Carlo on both a text reconstruction
  task and a multiple object tracking task.
