title: Wasserstein Propagation for Semi-Supervised Learning
abstract: Probability distributions and histograms are natural representations for
  product ratings, traffic measurements, and other data considered in many machine
  learning applications.  Thus, this paper introduces a technique for graph-based
  semi-supervised learning of histograms, derived from the theory of optimal transportation.
  Our method has several properties making it suitable for this application; in particular,
  its behavior can be characterized by the moments and shapes of the histograms at
  the labeled nodes. In addition, it can be used for histograms on non-standard domains
  like circles, revealing a strategy for manifold-valued semi-supervised learning.
  We also extend this technique to related problems such as smoothing distributions
  on graph nodes.
