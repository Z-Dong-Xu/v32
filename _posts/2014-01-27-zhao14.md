title: Robust Principal Component Analysis with Complex Noise
abstract: The research on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) has been attracting
  much attention recently. The original RPCA model assumes sparse noise, and use the
  L_1-norm to characterize the error term. In practice, however, the noise is much
  more complex and it is not appropriate to simply use a certain L_p-norm for noise
  modeling. We propose a generative RPCA model under the Bayesian framework by modeling
  data noise as a mixture of Gaussians (MoG). The MoG is a universal approximator
  to continuous distributions and thus our model is able to fit a wide range of noises
  such as Laplacian, Gaussian, sparse noises and any combinations of them. A variational
  Bayes algorithm is presented to infer the posterior of the proposed model. All involved
  parameters can be recursively updated in closed form. The advantage of our method
  is demonstrated by extensive experiments on synthetic data, face modeling and background
  subtraction.
