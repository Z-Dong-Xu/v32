title: Hierarchical Quasi-Clustering Methods for Asymmetric Networks
abstract: This paper introduces hierarchical quasi-clustering methods, a generalization
  of hierarchical clustering for asymmetric networks where the output structure preserves
  the asymmetry of the input data. We show that this output structure is equivalent
  to a finite quasi-ultrametric space and study admissibility with respect to two
  desirable properties. We prove that a modified version of single linkage is the
  only admissible quasi-clustering method. Moreover, we show stability of the proposed
  method and we establish invariance properties fulfilled by it. Algorithms are further
  developed and the value of quasi-clustering analysis is illustrated with a study
  of internal migration within United States.
