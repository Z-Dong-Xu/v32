title: On Robustness and Regularization of Structural Support Vector Machines
abstract: 'Previous analysis of binary SVMs has demonstrated a deep connection between
  robustness to perturbations over uncertainty sets and regularization of the  weights.  In
  this paper, we explore the problem of learning robust  models for structured prediction
  problems.  We first formulate the problem  of learning robust structural SVMs when
  there are perturbations in  the feature space.  We consider two different classes
  of uncertainty sets for the perturbations: ellipsoidal uncertainty sets and polyhedral
  uncertainty sets. In both cases, we show that the robust optimization problem is
  equivalent to the non-robust formulation with an additional regularizer. For the
  ellipsoidal uncertainty set, the additional regularizer is based on the dual norm
  of the norm that constrains the ellipsoidal uncertainty. For the polyhedral uncertainty
  set, we show that the robust optimization problem is equivalent to adding a linear
  regularizer in a transformed weight space related to the linear constraints of the
  polyhedron. We also show that  these constraint sets can be combined and demonstrate
  a number of  interesting special cases.  This represents the first theoretical  analysis
  of robust optimization of structural support vector machines. Our experimental results
  show that our method outperforms the nonrobust structural SVMs on real world data
  when the test data distributions is drifted from the training data distribution.'
