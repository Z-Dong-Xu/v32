title: Anti-differentiating approximation algorithms:A case study with min-cuts, spectral,
  and flow
abstract: 'We formalize and illustrate the general concept of algorithmic anti-differentiation:
  given an algorithmic procedure, e.g., an approximation algorithm for which worst-case
  approximation guarantees are available or a heuristic that has been engineered to
  be practically-useful but for which a precise theoretical understanding is lacking,
  an algorithmic anti-derivative is a precise statement of an optimization problem
  that is exactly solved by that procedure. We explore this concept with a case study
  of approximation algorithms for finding locally-biased partitions in data graphs,
  demonstrating connections between min-cut objectives, a personalized version of
  the popular PageRank vector, and the highly effective "push" procedure for computing
  an approximation to personalized PageRank. We show, for example, that this latter
  algorithm solves (exactly, but implicitly) an l1-regularized l2-regression problem,
  a fact that helps to explain its excellent performance in practice. We expect that,
  when available, these implicit optimization problems will be critical for rationalizing
  and predicting the performance of many approximation algorithms on realistic data.'
