title: Optimization Equivalence of Divergences Improves Neighbor Embedding
abstract: 'Visualization methods that arrange data objects in 2D or 3D layouts have
  followed two main schools, methods oriented for graph layout and methods oriented
  for vectorial embedding. We show the two previously separate approaches are tied
  by an optimization equivalence, making it possible to relate methods from the two
  approaches and to build new methods that take the best of both worlds.  In detail,
  we prove a theorem of optimization equivalences between beta- and gamma-, as well
  as alpha- and Renyi-divergences through a connection scalar. Through the equivalences
  we represent several nonlinear dimensionality reduction and graph drawing methods
  in a generalized stochastic neighbor embedding setting, where information divergences
  are minimized between similarities in input and output spaces, and the optimal connection
  scalar provides a natural choice for the tradeoff between attractive and repulsive
  forces. We give two examples of developing new visualization methods through the
  equivalences: 1) We develop weighted symmetric stochastic neighbor embedding (ws-SNE)
  from Elastic Embedding and analyze its benefits, good performance for both vectorial
  and network data; in experiments ws-SNE has good performance across data sets of
  different types, whereas comparison methods fail for some of the data sets; 2) we
  develop a gamma-divergence version of a PolyLog layout method; the new method is
  scale invariant in the output space and makes it possible to efficiently use large-scale
  smoothed neighborhoods.'
