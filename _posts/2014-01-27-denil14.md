title: 'Narrowing the Gap: Random Forests In Theory and In Practice'
abstract: Despite widespread interest and practical use, the theoretical properties
  of random forests are still not well understood. In this paper we contribute to
  this understanding in two ways. We present a new theoreti- cally tractable variant
  of random regression forests and prove that our algorithm is con- sistent. We also
  provide an empirical eval- uation, comparing our algorithm and other theoretically
  tractable random forest models to the random forest algorithm used in prac- tice.
  Our experiments provide insight into the relative importance of different simplifi-
  cations that theoreticians have made to ob- tain tractable models for analysis.
