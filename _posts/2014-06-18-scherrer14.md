title: 'Approximate Policy Iteration Schemes: A Comparison'
abstract: 'We consider the infinite-horizon discounted optimal control problem  formalized
  by Markov Decision Processes. We focus on several  approximate variations of the
  Policy Iteration algorithm: Approximate Policy Iteration, Conservative Policy Iteration  (CPI),
  a natural adaptation of the Policy Search by  Dynamic Programming algorithm to the  infinite-horizon
  case (PSDP_∞), and the recently proposed  Non-Stationary Policy iteration (NSPI(m)).
  For all  algorithms, we describe performance bounds, and  make a comparison by paying
  a particular attention to the  concentrability constants involved, the number of
  iterations and the  memory required. Our analysis highlights the following points:
  1) The  performance guarantee of CPI can be arbitrarily better than that of  API/API(α),
  but this comes at the cost of a  relative—exponential in \frac1ε—increase of the  number
  of iterations. 2) PSDP_∞enjoys the best of both worlds: its performance guarantee
  is similar to that of CPI, but within a number of iterations similar to that of
  API. 3) Contrary to API that  requires a constant memory, the memory needed by CPI
  and PSDP_∞is  proportional to their number of iterations, which may be problematic  when
  the discount factor γis close to 1 or the  approximation error εis close to 0; we
  show that  the NSPI(m) algorithm allows to make an overall trade-off between  memory
  and performance. Simulations with these schemes confirm our  analysis.'
