title: Stochastic Backpropagation and Approximate Inference in Deep Generative Models
abstract: We marry ideas from deep neural networks and approximate Bayesian inference
  to derive a generalised class of deep, directed generative models, endowed with
  a new algorithm for scalable inference and learning.   Our algorithm introduces
  a recognition model to represent an approximate posterior distribution and uses
  this for optimisation of a variational lower bound.  We develop stochastic backpropagation
  – rules for gradient backpropagation through stochastic variables – and   derive
  an algorithm that allows for joint optimisation of the parameters of both the generative
  and recognition models.  We demonstrate on several real-world data sets that by
  using stochastic backpropagation and variational inference, we obtain models that
  are able to  generate realistic samples of data, allow for accurate imputations
  of missing data, and provide a useful tool for high-dimensional data visualisation.
