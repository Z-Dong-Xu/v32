title: Nonnegative Sparse PCA with Provable Guarantees
abstract: 'We introduce a novel algorithm to compute nonnegative sparse principal
  components of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices. Our algorithm comes with approximation
  guarantees   contingent on the spectral profile of the input matrix A:  the sharper
  the eigenvalue decay, the better the approximation quality.    If the eigenvalues
  decay like any asymptotically vanishing function, we can approximate nonnegative
  sparse PCA within any accuracy εin time polynomial in the matrix size n and desired
  sparsity k, but not in 1/ε. Further, we obtain a data-dependent bound that is computed
  by executing an algorithm on a given data set. This bound is significantly tighter
  than a-priori bounds and can be used to show that for all tested datasets our algorithm
  is provably within 40%-90% from the unknown optimum.     Our algorithm is combinatorial
  and explores a subspace defined by the leading eigenvectors of A. We test our scheme
  on several data sets, showing that it matches or outperforms the previous state
  of the art.'
