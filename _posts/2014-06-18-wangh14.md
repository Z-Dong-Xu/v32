title: Nonlinear Information-Theoretic Compressive Measurement Design
abstract: We investigate design of general nonlinear functions for mapping high-dimensional
  data into a lower-dimensional (compressive) space. The nonlinear measurements are
  assumed contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. Depending on the application, we
  are either interested in recovering the high-dimensional data from the nonlinear
  compressive measurements, or performing classification directly based on these measurements.
  The latter case corresponds to classification based on nonlinearly constituted and
  noisy features. The nonlinear measurement functions are designed based on constrained
  mutual-information optimization. New analytic results are developed for the gradient
  of mutual information in this setting, for arbitrary input-signal  statistics. We
  make connections to kernel-based methods, such as the support vector machine. Encouraging
  results are presented on multiple datasets, for both signal recovery and classification.
  The nonlinear approach is shown to be particularly valuable in high-noise scenarios.
