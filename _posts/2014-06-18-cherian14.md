title: Nearest Neighbors Using Compact Sparse Codes
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for approximate nearest neighbor
  (ANN) retrieval based on dictionary learning and sparse coding. Our key innovation
  is to build compact codes, dubbed SpANN codes, using the active set of sparse coded
  data. These codes are then used to index an inverted file table for fast retrieval.
  The active sets are often found to be sensitive to small differences among data
  points, resulting in only near duplicate retrieval. We show that this sensitivity
  is related to the coherence of the dictionary; small coherence resulting in better
  retrieval. To this end, we propose a novel dictionary learning formulation with
  incoherence constraints and an efficient method to solve it. Experiments are conducted
  on two state-of-the-art computer vision datasets with 1M data points and show an
  order of magnitude improvement in retrieval accuracy without sacrificing memory
  and query time compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
