title: Discovering Latent Network Structure in Point Process Data
abstract: Networks play a central role in modern data analysis, enabling us to reason
  about systems by studying the relationships between their parts.  Most often in
  network analysis, the edges are given.  However, in many systems it is difficult
  or impossible to measure the network directly.  Examples of latent networks include
  economic interactions linking financial instruments and patterns of reciprocity
  in gang violence.  In these cases, we are limited to noisy observations of events
  associated with each node.  To enable analysis of these implicit networks, we develop
  a probabilistic model that combines mutually-exciting point processes with random
  graph models.  We show how the Poisson superposition principle enables an elegant
  auxiliary variable formulation and a fully-Bayesian, parallel inference algorithm.  We
  evaluate this new model empirically on several datasets.
