title: Learning Polynomials with Neural Networks
abstract: 'We study the effectiveness of learning low degree polynomials using   neural
  networks by the gradient descent method.  While neural   networks have been shown
  to have great expressive power, and gradient   descent has been widely used in practice
  for learning neural   networks, few theoretical guarantees are known for such methods.  In   particular,
  it is well known that gradient descent can get stuck at   local minima, even for
  simple classes of target functions.  In this   paper, we present several positive
  theoretical results to support the   effectiveness of neural networks.  We focus
  on two-layer neural   networks (i.e. one hidden layer) where the top layer node
  is a linear   function, similar to \citebarron93.  First we show that for a   randomly
  initialized neural network with sufficiently many hidden   units, the gradient descent
  method can learn any low degree   polynomial.  Secondly, we show that if we use
  complex-valued weights   (the target function can still be real), then under suitable   conditions,
  there are no “robust local minima”: the neural network   can always escape a local
  minimum by performing a random   perturbation. This property does not hold for real-valued
  weights.   Thirdly, we discuss whether sparse polynomials can be learned   with
  \emphsmall neural networks, where the size is dependent on the   sparsity of the
  target function.'
