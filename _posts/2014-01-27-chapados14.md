title: Effective Bayesian Modeling of Groups of Related Count Time Series
abstract: Time series of counts arise in a variety of forecasting applications, for
  which traditional models are generally inappropriate. This paper introduces a hierarchical
  Bayesian formulation applicable to count time series that can easily account for
  explanatory variables and share statistical strength across groups of related time
  series. We derive an efficient approximate inference technique, and illustrate its
  performance on a number of datasets from supply chain planning.
