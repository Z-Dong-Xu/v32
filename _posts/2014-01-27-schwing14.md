title: Globally Convergent Parallel MAP LP Relaxation Solver using the Frank-Wolfe
  Algorithm
abstract: While MAP inference is typically intractable for many real-world applications,
  linear programming relaxations have been proven very effective. Dual block-coordinate
  descent methods are among the most efficient solvers, however, they are prone to
  get stuck in sub-optimal  points. Although subgradient approaches achieve global
  convergence, they are typically slower in practice. To improve convergence speed,
  algorithms which compute the steepest Îµ-descent direction by solving a quadratic
  program have been proposed. In this paper we suggest to decouple the quadratic program
  based on the Frank-Wolfe approach. This allows us to obtain an efficient and easy
  to parallelize algorithm while retaining the global convergence properties. Our
  method proves superior when compared to existing algorithms on a set of spin-glass
  models and protein design tasks.
