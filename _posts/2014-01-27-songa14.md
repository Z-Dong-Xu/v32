title: Nonparametric Estimation of Multi-View Latent Variable Models
abstract: Spectral methods have greatly advanced the estimation of latent variable
  models, generating a sequence of novel and efficient algorithms with strong theoretical
  guarantees. However, current spectral algorithms are largely restricted to mixtures
  of discrete or Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we propose a kernel method
  for learning multi-view latent variable models, allowing each mixture component
  to be nonparametric and learned from data in an unsupervised fashion. The key idea
  of our method is to embed the joint distribution of a multi-view latent variable
  model into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and then the latent parameters are
  recovered using a robust tensor power method. We establish that the  sample complexity
  for the proposed method is quadratic in the number of latent components and is a
  low order polynomial in the other relevant parameters. Thus, our nonparametric tensor
  approach to learning latent variable models enjoys good sample and computational
  efficiencies. As a special case of our framework, we also obtain a first unsupervised
  conditional density estimator of the kind with provable guarantees. In both synthetic
  and real world datasets, the nonparametric tensor power method compares favorably
  to EM algorithm and other spectral algorithms.
