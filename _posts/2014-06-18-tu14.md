title: Making Fisher Discriminant Analysis Scalable
abstract: The Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical method for
  classification and dimension reduction jointly. A major limitation of the conventional
  LDA is a so-called singularity issue. Many LDA variants, especially two-stage methods
  such as PCA+LDA and LDA/QR,  were proposed to solve this issue. In the two-stage
  methods, an intermediate stage for dimension reduction is developed before  the
  actual LDA method works. These two-stage methods are scalable because they are an
  approximate alternative of the LDA method. However, there is no theoretical analysis
  on how well they approximate the conventional LDA problem. In this paper we present
  theoretical analysis on the approximation error of a two-stage algorithm. Accordingly,
  we develop a new two-stage algorithm. Furthermore, we resort to a random projection
  approach, making our algorithm scalable. We also provide an implemention on distributed
  system to handle large scale problems. Our algorithm takes LDA/QR as its special
  case, and outperforms PCA+LDA while having a similar scalability. We also generalize
  our algorithm to kernel discriminant analysis, a nonlinear version of the classical
  LDA. Extensive experiments show that our algorithms outperform PCA+LDA and have
  a similar scalability with it.
