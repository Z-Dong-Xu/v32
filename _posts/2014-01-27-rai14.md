title: Scalable Bayesian Low-Rank Decomposition of Incomplete Multiway Tensors
abstract: We present a scalable Bayesian framework for low-rank decomposition of multiway
  tensor data with missing observations. The key issue of pre-specifying the rank
  of the decomposition is sidestepped in a principled manner using a multiplicative
  gamma process prior. Both continuous and binary data can be analyzed under the framework,
  in a coherent way using fully conjugate Bayesian analysis. In particular, the analysis
  in the non-conjugate binary case is facilitated via the use of the PÃ³lya-Gamma sampling
  strategy which elicits closed-form Gibbs sampling updates. The resulting samplers
  are efficient and enable us to apply our framework to large-scale problems, with
  time-complexity that is linear in the number of observed entries in the tensor.
  This is especially attractive in analyzing very large but sparsely observed tensors
  with very few known entries. Moreover, our method admits easy extension to the supervised
  setting where entities in one or more tensor modes have labels. Our method outperforms
  several state-of-the-art tensor decomposition methods on various synthetic and benchmark
  real-world datasets.
