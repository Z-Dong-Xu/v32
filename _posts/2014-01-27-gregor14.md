title: Deep AutoRegressive Networks
abstract: 'We introduce a deep, generative autoencoder capable of learning hierarchies
  of distributed representations from data.  Successive deep stochastic hidden layers
  are equipped with autoregressive connections, which enable the model to be sampled
  from quickly and exactly via ancestral sampling.  We derive an efficient approximate
  parameter estimation method based on the minimum  description length (MDL) principle,  which
  can be seen as maximising a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood, with
  a feedforward neural network implementing approximate inference.   We demonstrate
  state-of-the-art generative performance on a number of classic data sets: several
  UCI data sets, MNIST and Atari 2600 games.'
