title: Consistency of Causal Inference under the Additive Noise Model
abstract: We analyze a family of methods for statistical  causal inference from sample
  under the so-called  Additive Noise Model. While most work  on the subject has concentrated
  on establishing  the soundness of the Additive Noise Model, the  statistical consistency
  of the resulting inference  methods has received little attention. We derive  general
  conditions under which the given family  of inference methods consistently infers
  the  causal direction in a nonparametric setting.
