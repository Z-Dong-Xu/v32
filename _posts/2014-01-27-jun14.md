title: Memory (and Time) Efficient Sequential Monte Carlo
abstract: Memory efficiency is an important issue in Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
  algorithms, arising for example in inference of high-dimensional latent variables
  via Rao-Blackwellized SMC algorithms, where the size of individual particles combined
  with the required number of particles can stress the main memory. Standard SMC methods
  have a memory requirement that scales linearly in the number of particles present
  at all stage of the algorithm.   Our contribution is a simple scheme that makes
  the memory cost of SMC methods depends on the number of distinct particles that
  survive resampling.   We show that this difference has a large empirical impact
  on the quality of the approximation in realistic scenarios, and also—since memory
  access is generally slow—on the running time.    The method is based on a two pass
  generation of the particles, which are represented implicitly in the first pass.   We
  parameterize the accuracy of our algorithm with a memory budget rather than with
  a fixed number of particles. Our algorithm adaptively selects an optimal number
  of particle to exploit this fixed memory budget. We show that this adaptation does
  not interfere with the usual consistency guarantees that come with SMC algorithms.
