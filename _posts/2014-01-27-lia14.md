title: Condensed Filter Tree for Cost-Sensitive Multi-Label Classification
abstract: Different real-world applications of multi-label classification often demand
  different evaluation criteria. We formalize this demand with a general setup, cost-sensitive
  multi-label classification (CSMLC), which takes  the evaluation criteria into account
  during learning. Nevertheless, most existing algorithms can only focus on optimizing
  a few specific evaluation criteria, and cannot systematically deal with different
  ones. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called condensed filter tree
  (CFT), for optimizing any criteria in CSMLC. CFT is derived from reducing CSMLC
  to the famous filter tree algorithm for cost-sensitive multi-class classification
  via constructing the label powerset. We successfully cope with the difficulty of
  having exponentially many extended-classes within the powerset for representation,
  training and prediction by carefully designing the tree structure and focusing on
  the key nodes. Experimental results across many real-world datasets validate that
  CFT is competitive with special purpose algorithms on special criteria and reaches
  better performance on general criteria.
