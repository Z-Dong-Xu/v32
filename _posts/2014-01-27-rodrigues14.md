title: Gaussian Process Classification and Active Learning with Multiple Annotators
abstract: Learning from multiple annotators took a valuable step towards modelling
  data that does not fit the usual single annotator setting. However, multiple annotators
  sometimes offer varying degrees of expertise. When disagreements arise, the establishment
  of the correct label through trivial solutions such as majority voting may not be
  adequate, since without considering heterogeneity in the annotators, we risk generating
  a flawed model.   In this paper, we extend GP classification in order to account
  for multiple annotators with different levels expertise. By explicitly handling
  uncertainty, Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a natural framework to build proper
  multiple-annotator models. We empirically show that our model significantly outperforms
  other commonly used approaches, such as majority voting, without a significant increase
  in the computational cost of approximate Bayesian inference. Furthermore, an active
  learning methodology is proposed, which is able to reduce annotation cost even further.
