title: K-means recovers ICA filters when independent components are sparse
abstract: Unsupervised feature learning is the task of using unlabeled examples  for
  building a representation of objects as vectors. This task has  been extensively
  studied in recent years, mainly in the context of  unsupervised pre-training of
  neural networks. Recently, (Coates et al., 2011)  conducted extensive experiments,
  comparing the accuracy of a linear  classifier that has been trained using features
  learnt by several  unsupervised feature learning methods.  Surprisingly, the best  performing
  method was the simplest feature learning approach that was  based on applying the
  K-means clustering algorithm after a whitening  of the data. The goal of this work
  is to shed light on the success of  K-means with whitening for the task of unsupervised
  feature learning.  Our main result is a close connection between K-means and ICA  (Independent
  Component Analysis).  Specifically, we show that K-means  and similar clustering
  algorithms can be used to recover the ICA  mixing matrix or its inverse, the ICA
  filters. It is well known that  the independent components found by ICA form useful
  features for  classification (Le et al., 2012; 2011; 2010), hence the connection
  between K-mean and ICA explains  the empirical success of K-means as a feature learner.
  Moreover, our  analysis underscores the significance of the whitening operation,
  as was also  observed in the experiments reported in (Coates et al., 2011).  Finally,
  our  analysis leads to a better initialization of K-means for the task of feature
  learning.
