title: Scalable Semidefinite Relaxation for Maximum A Posterior Estimation
abstract: Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference over discrete Markov random fields
  is a central task spanning a wide spectrum of real-world applications but known
  to be NP-hard for general graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel semidefinite
  relaxation formulation (referred to as SDR) to estimate the MAP assignment. Algorithmically,
  we develop an accelerated variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers
  (referred to as SDPAD-LR) that can effectively exploit the special structure of
  SDR. Encouragingly, the proposed procedure allows solving SDR for large-scale problems,  e.g.
  problems comprising hundreds of thousands of variables with multiple states on a
  grid graph. Compared with prior SDP solvers, SDPAD-LR is capable of attaining comparable
  accuracy while exhibiting remarkably improved scalability. This contradicts the
  commonly held belief that semidefinite relaxation can only been applied on small-scale
  problems. We have evaluated the performance of SDR on various benchmark datasets
  including OPENGM2 and PIC. Experimental results demonstrate that for a broad class
  of problems, SDPAD-LR  outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in producing better
  MAP assignments.
