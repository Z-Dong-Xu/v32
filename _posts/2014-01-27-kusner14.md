title: Stochastic Neighbor Compression
abstract: 'We present Stochastic Neighborhood Compression (SNC), an algorithm to compress
  a dataset for the purpose of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification. Given training
  data, SNC learns a much smaller synthetic data set, that minimizes the stochastic
  1-nearest neighbor classification error on the training data. This approach has
  several appealing properties: due to its small size, the compressed set speeds up
  kNN testing drastically (up to several orders of magnitude, in our experiments);
  it makes the kNN classifier substantially more robust to label noise; on 4 of 7
  data sets it yields lower test error than kNN on the entire training set, even at
  compression ratios as low as 2%; finally, the SNC compression leads to impressive
  speed ups over kNN even when kNN and SNC are both used with ball-tree data structures,
  hashing, and LMNN dimensionality reduction, demonstrating that it is complementary
  to existing state-of-the-art algorithms to speed up kNN classification and leads
  to substantial further improvements.'
