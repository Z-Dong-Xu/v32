title: Forward-Backward Greedy Algorithms for General Convex Smooth Functions over
  A Cardinality Constraint
abstract: 'We consider forward-backward greedy algorithms for solving sparse feature
  selection problems with general convex smooth functions. A state-of-the-art greedy
  method, the Forward-Backward greedy algorithm (FoBa-obj) requires to solve a large
  number of optimization problems, thus it is not scalable for large-size problems.
  The FoBa-gdt algorithm, which uses the gradient information for feature selection
  at each forward iteration, significantly improves the efficiency of FoBa-obj. In
  this paper, we systematically analyze the theoretical properties of both algorithms.
  Our main contributions are: 1) We derive better theoretical bounds than existing
  analyses regarding FoBa-obj for general smooth convex functions; 2) We show that
  FoBa-gdt achieves the same theoretical performance as FoBa-obj under the same condition:
  restricted strong convexity condition. Our new bounds are consistent with the bounds
  of a special case (least squares) and fills a previously existing theoretical gap
  for general convex smooth functions; 3) We show that the restricted strong convexity
  condition is satisfied if the number of independent samples is more than \bark\log
  d where \bark is the sparsity number and d is the dimension of the variable; 4)
  We apply FoBa-gdt (with the conditional random field objective) to the sensor selection
  problem for human indoor activity recognition and our results show that FoBa-gdt
  outperforms other methods based on forward greedy selection and L1-regularization.'
