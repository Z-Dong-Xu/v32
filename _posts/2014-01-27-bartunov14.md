title: Variational Inference for Sequential Distance Dependent Chinese Restaurant
  Process
abstract: Recently proposed distance dependent Chinese Restaurant Process (ddCRP)
  generalizes extensively used Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) by accounting for
  dependencies between data points. Its posterior is intractable and so far only MCMC
  methods were used for inference. Because of very different nature of ddCRP no prior
  developments in variational methods for Bayesian nonparametrics are appliable. In
  this paper we propose novel variational inference for important sequential case
  of ddCRP (seqddCRP) by revealing its connection with Laplacian of random graph constructed
  by the process. We develop efficient algorithm for optimizing variational lower
  bound and demonstrate its efficiency comparing to Gibbs sampler. We also apply our
  variational approximation to CRP-equivalent seqddCRP-mixture model, where it could
  be considered as alternative to one based on truncated stick-breaking representation.
  This allowed us to achieve significantly better variational lower bound than variational
  approximation based on truncated stick breaking for Dirichlet process.
