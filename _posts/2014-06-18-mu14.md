title: 'Square Deal: Lower Bounds and Improved Relaxations for Tensor Recovery'
abstract: 'Recovering a low-rank tensor from incomplete information is a recurring
  problem in signal processing and machine learning. The most popular convex relaxation
  of this problem minimizes the sum of the nuclear norms (SNN) of the unfolding matrices
  of the tensor. We show that this approach can be substantially suboptimal: reliably
  recovering a K-way n\timesn\times⋯\times n tensor of Tucker rank (r, r, \ldots,
  r) from Gaussian measurements requires Ω( r n^K-1 ) observations. In contrast, a
  certain (intractable) nonconvex formulation needs only O(r^K + nrK) observations.
  We introduce a simple, new convex relaxation, which partially bridges this gap.
  Our new formulation succeeds with O(r^⌊K/2 ⌋n^⌈K/2 ⌉) observations. The lower bound
  for the SNN model follows from our new result on recovering signals with multiple
  structures (e.g. sparse, low rank), which indicates the significant suboptimality
  of the common approach of minimizing the sum of individual sparsity inducing norms
  (e.g. \ell_1, nuclear norm). Our new tractable formulation for low-rank tensor recovery
  shows how the sample complexity can be reduced by designing convex regularizers
  that exploit several structures jointly.'
