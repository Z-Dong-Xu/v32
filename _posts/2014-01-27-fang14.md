title: 'Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning: Realizing Pointwise Smoothness Probabilistically'
abstract: 'As the central notion in semi-supervised learning, smoothness is often
  realized on a graph representation of the data. In this paper, we study two complementary
  dimensions of smoothness: its pointwise nature and probabilistic modeling. While
  no existing graph-based work exploits them in conjunction, we encompass both in
  a novel framework of Probabilistic Graph-based Pointwise Smoothness (PGP), building
  upon two foundational models of data closeness and label coupling. This new form
  of smoothness axiomatizes a set of probability constraints, which ultimately enables
  class prediction. Theoretically, we provide an error and robustness analysis of
  PGP. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to show the advantages of PGP.'
