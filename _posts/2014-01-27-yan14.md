title: Coupled Group Lasso for Web-Scale CTR Prediction in Display Advertising
abstract: In display advertising, click through rate(CTR) prediction is the problem
  of estimating the probability  that an advertisement (ad) is clicked when displayed
  to a user in a specific context. Due to its easy implementation and promising performance,
  logistic regression(LR) model has been widely used for CTR prediction, especially
  in industrial systems. However, it is not easy for LR to capture the nonlinear information,
  such as the conjunction information, from user features and ad features. In this
  paper, we propose a novel model, called coupled group lasso(CGL), for CTR prediction
  in display advertising. CGL can seamlessly integrate the conjunction information
  from user features and ad features for modeling. Furthermore, CGL can automatically
  eliminate useless features for both users and ads, which may facilitate fast online
  prediction. Scalability of CGL is ensured through feature hashing and distributed
  implementation. Experimental results on real-world data sets show that our CGL model
  can achieve state-of-the-art performance on web-scale CTR prediction tasks.
