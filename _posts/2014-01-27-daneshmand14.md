title: 'Estimating Diffusion Network Structures: Recovery Conditions, Sample Complexity
  & Soft-thresholding Algorithm'
abstract: Information spreads across social and technological networks, but often
  the network structures are hidden from us and we only observe the traces left by
  the diffusion processes, called cascades. Can we recover the hidden network structures
  from these observed cascades? What kind of cascades and how many cascades do we
  need? Are there some network structures which are more difficult than others to
  recover? Can we design efficient inference algorithms with provable guarantees?    Despite
  the increasing availability of cascade data and methods for inferring networks from
  these data, a thorough theoretical understanding of the above questions remains
  largely unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the network
  structure inference problem for a general family of continuous-time diffusion models
  using an l1-regularized likelihood maximization framework. We show that, as long
  as the cascade sampling process satisfies a natural incoherence condition, our framework
  can recover the correct network structure with high probability if we observe O(d^3
  log N) cascades, where d is the maximum number of parents of a node and N is the
  total number of nodes. Moreover, we develop a simple and efficient soft-thresholding
  inference algorithm, which we use to illustrate the consequences of our theoretical
  results, and show that our framework outperforms other alternatives in practice.
