title: Latent Bandits.
abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit problem where the reward distributions
  are indexed by two sets –one for arms, one for type– and can be partitioned into
  a small number of clusters according to the type. First, we consider the setting
  where all reward distributions are known and all types have the same underlying
  cluster, the type’s identity is, however, unknown. Second, we study the case  where
  types may come from different classes, which is significantly more challenging.
  Finally, we tackle the case where the reward distributions are completely unknown.
  In each setting, we introduce specific algorithms and derive non-trivial regret
  performance. Numerical experiments show that,  in the most challenging agnostic
  case, the proposed algorithm  achieves excellent performance in several difficult
  scenarios.
