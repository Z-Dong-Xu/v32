title: 'Factorized Point Process Intensities: A Spatial Analysis of Professional Basketball'
abstract: We develop a machine learning approach to represent and analyze the underlying
  spatial structure that governs shot selection among professional basketball players
  in the NBA.  Typically, NBA players are discussed and compared in an heuristic,
  imprecise manner that relies on unmeasured intuitions about player behavior.  This
  makes it difficult to draw comparisons between players and make accurate player
  specific predictions.  Modeling shot attempt data as a point process, we create
  a low dimensional representation of offensive player types in the NBA.  Using non-negative
  matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique,
  we show that a low-rank spatial decomposition summarizes the shooting habits of
  NBA players.  The spatial representations discovered by the algorithm correspond
  to intuitive descriptions of NBA player types, and can be used to model other spatial
  effects, such as shooting accuracy.
