title: Learning Ordered Representations with Nested Dropout
abstract: In this paper, we present results on ordered representations of data in
  which different dimensions have different degrees of importance. To learn these
  representations we introduce nested dropout, a procedure for stochastically removing
  coherent nested sets of hidden units in a neural network. We first present a sequence
  of theoretical results in the simple case of a semi-linear autoencoder.  We rigorously
  show that the application of nested dropout enforces identifiability of the units,
  which leads to an exact equivalence with PCA.  We then extend the algorithm to deep
  models and demonstrate the relevance of ordered representations to a number of applications.  Specifically,
  we use the ordered property of the learned codes to construct hash-based data structures
  that permit very fast retrieval, achieving retrieval in time logarithmic in the
  database size and independent of the dimensionality of the representation. This
  allows the use of codes that are hundreds of times longer than currently feasible
  for retrieval.  We therefore avoid the diminished quality associated with short
  codes, while still performing retrieval that is competitive in speed with existing
  methods.  We also show that ordered representations are a promising way to learn
  adaptive compression for efficient online data reconstruction.
