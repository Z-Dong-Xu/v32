title: Bayesian Nonparametric Multilevel Clustering with Group-Level Contexts
abstract: 'We present a Bayesian nonparametric framework for multilevel clustering
  which utilizes group-level context information to simultaneously discover low-dimensional
  structures of the group contents and partitions groups into clusters. Using the
  Dirichlet process as the building block, our model constructs a product base-measure
  with a nested structure to accommodate content and context observations at multiple
  levels. The proposed model possesses properties that link the nested Dirichlet processes
  (nDP) and the Dirichlet process mixture models (DPM) in an interesting way: integrating
  out all contents results in the DPM over contexts, whereas integrating out group-speciﬁc
  contexts results in the nDP mixture over content variables. We provide a Polya-urn
  view of the model and an efﬁcient collapsed Gibbs inference procedure. Extensive
  experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the advantage of utilizing context
  information via our model in both text and image domains.'
