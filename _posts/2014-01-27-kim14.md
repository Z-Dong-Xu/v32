title: Hierarchical Dirichlet Scaling Process
abstract: We present the hierarchical Dirichlet scaling process (HDSP), a Bayesian
  nonparametric mixed membership model for multi-labeled data. We construct the HDSP
  based on the gamma representation of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) which
  allows scaling the mixture components. With such construction, HDSP allocates a
  latent location to each label and mixture component in a space, and uses the distance
  between them to guide membership probabilities. We develop a variational Bayes algorithm
  for the approximate posterior inference of the HDSP. Through experiments on synthetic
  datasets as well as datasets of newswire, medical journal articles, and Wikipedia,
  we show that the HDSP results in better predictive performance than HDP, labeled
  LDA and partially labeled LDA.
