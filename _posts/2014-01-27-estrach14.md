title: Signal recovery from Pooling Representations
abstract: Pooling operators construct non-linear representations  by cascading a redundant
  linear transform, followed by   a point-wise nonlinearity and a local aggregation,
  typically  implemented with a \ell_p norm.   Their efficiency in recognition architectures
  is based   on their ability to locally contract the input space,   but also on their
  capacity to retain as much stable information   as possible.  We address this latter
  question by computing the upper and   lower Lipschitz bounds of \ell_p pooling operators
  for p=1, 2, âˆžas well as their half-rectified equivalents, which give  sufficient
  conditions for the design of invertible pooling layers.  Numerical experiments on
  MNIST and image patches confirm that  pooling layers can be inverted with phase
  recovery algorithms. Moreover,  the regularity of the inverse pooling, controlled
  by the lower Lipschitz constant,   is empirically verified with a nearest neighbor
  regression.
