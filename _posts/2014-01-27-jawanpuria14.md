title: On p-norm Path Following in Multiple Kernel Learning for Non-linear Feature
  Selection
abstract: Our objective is to develop formulations and algorithms for efficiently
  computing the feature selection path â€“ i.e. the variation in classification accuracy
  as the fraction of selected features is varied from null to unity. Multiple Kernel
  Learning subject to l_p\geq1 regularization (l_p-MKL) has been demonstrated to be
  one of the most effective techniques for non-linear feature selection. However,
  state-of-the-art l_p-MKL algorithms are too computationally expensive to be invoked
  thousands of times to determine the entire path.    We propose a novel conjecture
  which states that, for certain l_p-MKL formulations, the number of features selected
  in the optimal solution monotonically decreases as p is decreased from an initial
  value to unity. We prove the conjecture, for a generic family of kernel target alignment
  based formulations, and show that the feature weights themselves decay (grow) monotonically
  once they are below (above) a certain threshold at optimality. This allows us to
  develop a path following algorithm that systematically generates optimal feature
  sets of decreasing size. The proposed algorithm sets certain feature weights directly
  to zero for potentially large intervals of p thereby reducing optimization costs
  while simultaneously providing approximation guarantees.    We empirically demonstrate
  that our formulation can lead to classification accuracies which are as much as
  10% higher on benchmark data sets not only as compared to other l_p-MKL formulations
  and uniform kernel baselines but also leading feature selection methods. We further
  demonstrate that our algorithm reduces training time significantly over other path
  following algorithms and state-of-the-art l_p-MKL optimizers such as SMO-MKL. In
  particular, we generate the entire feature selection path for data sets with a hundred
  thousand features in approximately half an hour on standard hardware.
