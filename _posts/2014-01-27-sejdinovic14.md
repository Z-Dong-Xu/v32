title: Kernel Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings
abstract: 'A Kernel Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is introduced, for the
  purpose of sampling from a target distribution with strongly nonlinear support.
  The algorithm embeds the trajectory of the Markov chain into a reproducing kernel
  Hilbert space (RKHS), such that the feature space covariance of the samples informs
  the choice of proposal. The procedure is computationally efficient and straightforward
  to implement, since the RKHS moves can be integrated out analytically: our proposal
  distribution in the original space is a normal distribution whose mean and covariance
  depend on where the current sample lies in the support of the target distribution,
  and adapts to its local covariance structure. Furthermore, the procedure requires
  neither gradients nor any other higher order information about the target, making
  it particularly attractive for contexts such as Pseudo-Marginal MCMC. Kernel Adaptive
  Metropolis-Hastings outperforms competing fixed and adaptive samplers on multivariate,
  highly nonlinear target distributions, arising in both real-world and synthetic
  examples.'
