title: Learning Mixtures of Linear Classifiers
abstract: We consider a discriminative learning (regression) problem, whereby the
  regression function is a convex combination of k linear classifiers. Existing approaches
  are based on the EM algorithm, or similar techniques, without provable guarantees.
  We develop a simple method based on spectral techniques and a ‘mirroring’ trick,
  that discovers the subspace spanned by the classifiers’ parameter vectors. Under
  a probabilistic assumption on the  feature vector distribution, we prove that this
  approach has nearly optimal statistical efficiency.
