title: Exchangeable Variable Models
abstract: A sequence of random variables is exchangeable if its joint distribution
  is invariant under variable permutations. We introduce exchangeable variable models
  (EVMs) as a novel class of probabilistic models whose basic building blocks are
  partially exchangeable sequences, a generalization of exchangeable sequences. We
  prove that a family of tractable EVMs is optimal under zero-one loss for a large
  class of functions, including parity and threshold functions, and strictly subsumes
  existing tractable independence-based model families. Extensive experiments show
  that EVMs outperform state of the art classifiers such as SVMs and  probabilistic
  models which are solely based on independence assumptions.
