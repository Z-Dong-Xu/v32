title: 'Optimal Budget Allocation: Theoretical Guarantee and Efficient Algorithm'
abstract: We consider the budget allocation problem over bipartite influence model
  proposed by Alon et al. This problem can be viewed as the well-known influence maximization
  problem with budget constraints.     We first show that this problem and its much
  more general form  fall into a general setting; namely the monotone submodular function
  maximization over integer lattice subject to a knapsack constraint.  Our framework
  includes Alon et al.â€™s model, even with a competitor and with cost.  We then give
  a (1-1/e)-approximation algorithm for this more general problem. Furthermore, when
  influence probabilities are nonincreasing, we obtain a faster (1-1/e)-approximation
  algorithm, which runs essentially in linear time in the number of nodes. This allows
  us to implement our algorithm up to almost 10M edges (indeed, our experiments tell
  us that we can implement our algorithm up to 1 billion edges. It would approximately
  take us only 500 seconds.).
