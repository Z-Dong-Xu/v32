title: Kernel Mean Estimation and Stein Effect
abstract: A mean function in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), or a kernel
  mean, is an important part of many algorithms ranging from kernel principal component
  analysis to Hilbert-space embedding of distributions. Given a finite sample, an
  empirical average is the standard estimate for the true kernel mean. We show that
  this estimator can be improved due to a well-known phenomenon in statistics called
  Stein phenomenon. After consideration, our theoretical analysis reveals the existence
  of a wide class of estimators that are better than the standard one. Focusing on
  a subset of this class, we propose efficient shrinkage estimators for the kernel
  mean. Empirical evaluations on several applications clearly demonstrate that the
  proposed estimators outperform the standard kernel mean estimator.
