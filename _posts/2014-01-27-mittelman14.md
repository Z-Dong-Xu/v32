title: Structured Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machines
abstract: The Recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann machine (RTRBM) is a probabilistic
  model for temporal data, that has been shown to effectively capture both short and
  long-term dependencies in time-series. The topology of the RTRBM graphical model,
  however, assumes full connectivity between all the pairs of visible and hidden units,
  therefore ignoring the dependency structure between the different observations.
  Learning this structure has the potential to not only improve the prediction performance,
  but it can also reveal important patterns in the data. For example, given an econometric
  dataset, we could identify interesting dependencies between different market sectors;
  given a meteorological dataset, we could identify regional weather patterns. In
  this work we propose a new class of RTRBM, which explicitly uses a dependency graph
  to model the structure in the problem and to define the energy function. We refer
  to the new model as the structured RTRBM (SRTRBM). Our technique is related to methods
  such as graphical lasso, which are used to learn the topology of Gaussian graphical
  models. We also develop a spike-and-slab version of the RTRBM, and combine it with
  our method to learn structure in datasets with real valued observations. Our experimental
  results using synthetic and real datasets, demonstrate that the SRTRBM can improve
  the prediction performance of the RTRBM, particularly when the number of visible
  units is large and the size of the training set is small. It also reveals the structure
  underlying our benchmark datasets.
