title: Anomaly Ranking as Supervised Bipartite Ranking
abstract: The Mass Volume (MV) curve is a visual  tool to evaluate the performance
  of a scoring  function with regard to its capacity to rank  data in the same order
  as the underlying density function. Anomaly ranking refers to the  unsupervised
  learning task which consists in  building a scoring function, based on unlabeled
  data, with a MV curve as low as possible at any point. In this paper, it is proved  that,
  in the case where the data generating probability distribution has compact support,
  anomaly ranking is equivalent to (supervised) bipartite ranking, where the goal
  is  to discriminate between the underlying probability distribution and the uniform
  distribution with same support. In this situation, the  MV curve can be then seen
  as a simple transform of the corresponding ROC curve. Exploiting this view, we then
  show how to use  bipartite ranking algorithms, possibly combined with random sampling,
  to solve the  MV curve minimization problem. Numerical experiments based on a variety
  of bipartite ranking algorithms well-documented in  the literature are displayed
  in order to illustrate the relevance of our approach.
