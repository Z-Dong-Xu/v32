title: A Bayesian Wilcoxon signed-rank test based on the Dirichlet process
abstract: Bayesian methods are ubiquitous in machine learning.  Nevertheless, the
  analysis of empirical results is typically   performed  by frequentist tests. This
  implies dealing with  null hypothesis significance tests and  p-values, even though
  the   shortcomings of such methods are well known.   We propose  a nonparametric
  Bayesian version of the Wilcoxon   signed-rank test using a Dirichlet process (DP)
  based prior.  We address in two different ways the problem of how to choose  the   infinite
  dimensional parameter that characterizes the DP.   The proposed  test has all the
  traditional strengths of the Bayesian   approach; for instance, unlike the frequentist
  tests,   it allows verifying the null hypothesis, not only rejecting it, and   taking
  decision which minimize the expected loss.  Moreover, one of the solutions proposed
  to model the infinitedimensional parameter of the DP, allows isolating instances
  in which the traditional frequentist test is guessing at random.   We show results
  dealing with the comparison of two classifiers using real and simulated data.
