title: Estimating Latent-Variable Graphical Models using Moments and Likelihoods
abstract: Recent work in method of moments provide consistent estimates for  latent-variable
  models, avoiding local optima issues, but these methods can  only be applied to
  certain types of graphical models. In this work, we show  that the method of moments
  in conjunction with a composite marginal likelihood  objective yields consistent
  parameter estimates for a much broader class of  directed and undirected graphical
  models, including loopy graphs with high  treewidth. Specifically, we use tensor
  factorization to reveal partial  information about the hidden variables, rendering
  the otherwise non-convex  negative log-likelihood convex. Our approach gracefully
  extends to models  outside our class by incorporating the partial information via
  posterior  regulraization.
