title: Active Learning of Parameterized Skills
abstract: We introduce a method for actively learning parameterized skills. Parameterized
  skills are flexible behaviors that can solve any task drawn from a distribution
  of parameterized reinforcement learning problems. Approaches to learning such skills
  have been proposed, but limited attention has been given to identifying which training
  tasks allow for rapid skill acquisition. We construct a non-parametric Bayesian
  model of skill performance and derive analytical expressions for a novel acquisition
  criterion capable of identifying tasks that maximize expected improvement in skill
  performance. We also introduce a spatiotemporal kernel tailored for non-stationary
  skill performance models. The proposed method is agnostic to policy and skill representation
  and scales independently of task dimensionality. We evaluate it on a non-linear
  simulated catapult control problem over arbitrarily mountainous terrains.
