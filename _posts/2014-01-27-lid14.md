title: Latent Semantic Representation Learning for Scene Classification
abstract: The performance of machine learning methods is heavily dependent on the
  choice of data representation. In real world applications such as scene recognition
  problems, the widely used low-level input features can fail to explain the high-level
  semantic label concepts. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a novel
  patch-based latent variable model to integrate latent contextual representation
  learning and classification model training in one joint optimization framework.
  Within this framework, the latent layer of variables bridge the gap between inputs
  and outputs by providing discriminative explanations for the semantic output labels,
  while being predictable from the low-level input features. Experiments conducted
  on standard scene recognition tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach,
  comparing to the state-of-the-art scene recognition methods.
