title: Towards an optimal stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers
abstract: 'We study regularized stochastic convex optimization subject to linear equality
  constraints. This class of problems was recently also studied by Ouyang et al. (2013)
  and Suzuki (2013); both introduced similar stochastic alternating direction method
  of multipliers (SADMM) algorithms. However, the analysis of both papers led to suboptimal
  convergence rates. This paper presents two new SADMM methods: (i) the first attains
  the minimax optimal rate of O(1/k) for nonsmooth strongly-convex stochastic problems;
  while (ii) the second progresses towards an optimal rate by exhibiting an O(1/k^2)
  rate for the smooth part. We present several experiments with our new methods; the
  results indicate improved performance over competing ADMM methods.'
