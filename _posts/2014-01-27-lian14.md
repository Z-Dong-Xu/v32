title: Modeling Correlated Arrival Events with Latent Semi-Markov Processes
abstract: The analysis and characterization of correlated point process data has wide
  applications, ranging from biomedical research to network analysis. In this work,
  we model such data as generated by a latent collection of continuous-time binary
  semi-Markov processes, corresponding to external events appearing and disappearing.
  A continuous-time modeling framework is more appropriate for multichannel point
  process data than a binning approach requiring time discretization, and we show
  connections between our model and recent ideas from the discrete-time literature.
  We describe an efficient MCMC algorithm for posterior inference, and apply our ideas
  to both synthetic data and a real-world biometrics application.
