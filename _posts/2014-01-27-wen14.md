title: 'Robust Learning under Uncertain Test Distributions: Relating Covariate Shift
  to Model Misspecification'
abstract: Many learning situations involve learning the conditional distribution p(y|x)
  when the training instances are drawn from the training distribution p_tr(x), even
  though it will later be used to predict for instances drawn from a different test
  distribution p_te(x).   Most current approaches focus on learning how to reweigh
  the training examples, to make them resemble the test distribution.   However, reweighing
  does not always help, because (we show that) the test error also depends on the
  correctness of the underlying model class.   This paper analyses this situation
  by viewing the problem of learning under changing distributions as a game between
  a learner and an adversary.   We characterize when such reweighing is needed, and
  also provide an algorithm, robust covariate shift adjustment (RCSA), that provides
  relevant weights.   Our empirical studies, on UCI datasets and a real-world cancer
  prognostic prediction dataset, show that our analysis applies, and that our RCSA
  works effectively.
