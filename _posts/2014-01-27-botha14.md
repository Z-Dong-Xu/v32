title: Compositional Morphology for Word Representations and Language Modelling
abstract: This paper presents a scalable method for integrating compositional morphological
  representations into a vector-based probabilistic language model. Our approach is
  evaluated in the context of log-bilinear language models, rendered suitably efficient
  for implementation inside a machine translation decoder by factoring the vocabulary.
  We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, presenting results on a range
  of languages which demonstrate that our model learns morphological representations
  that both perform well on word similarity tasks and lead to substantial reductions
  in perplexity. When used for translation into morphologically rich languages with
  large vocabularies, our models obtain improvements of up to 1.2 BLEU points relative
  to a baseline system using back-off n-gram models.
