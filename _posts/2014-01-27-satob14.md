title: Latent Confusion Analysis by Normalized Gamma Construction
abstract: 'We developed a flexible framework for modeling the annotation and judgment
  processes of humans, which we called “normalized gamma construction of a confusion
  matrix.”  This framework enabled us to model three properties: (1) the abilities
  of humans, (2) a confusion matrix with labeling, and (3) the difficulty with which
  items are correctly annotated.  We also provided the concept of “latent confusion
  analysis (LCA),” whose main purpose was to analyze the principal confusions behind
  human annotations and judgments.  It is assumed in LCA that confusion matrices are
  shared between persons, which we called “latent confusions”, in tribute to the “latent
  topics” of topic modeling.  We aim at summarizing the workers’ confusion matrices
  with the small number of latent principal confusion matrices because many personal
  confusion matrices is difficult to analyze.  We used LCA to analyze latent confusions
  regarding the effects of radioactivity on  fish and shellfish following the Fukushima
  Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011.'
