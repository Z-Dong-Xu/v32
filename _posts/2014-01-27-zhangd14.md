title: Composite Quantization for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search
abstract: This paper presents a novel compact coding approach, composite quantization,
  for approximate nearest neighbor search. The idea is to use the composition of several
  elements selected from the dictionaries to accurately approximate a vector and to
  represent the vector by a short code composed of the indices of the selected elements.
  To efficiently compute the approximate distance of a query to a database vector
  using the short code, we introduce an extra constraint, constant inter-dictionary-element-product,
  resulting in that  approximating the distance only using the distance of the query
  to each selected element is enough for nearest neighbor search. Experimental comparison
  with state-of-the-art algorithms over several benchmark datasets demonstrates the
  efficacy of the proposed approach.
