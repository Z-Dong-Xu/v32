title: Learning to Disentangle Factors of Variation with Manifold Interaction
abstract: Many latent factors of variation interact to generate sensory data; for
  example pose, morphology and expression in face images. We propose to learn manifold
  coordinates for the relevant factors of variation and to model their joint interaction.
  Most existing feature learning algorithms focus on a single task and extract features
  that are sensitive to the task-relevant factors and invariant to all others. However,
  models that just extract a single set of invariant features do not exploit the relationships
  among the latent factors. To address this we propose a higher-order Boltzmann machine
  that incorporates multiplicative interactions among groups of hidden units that
  each learn to encode a factor of variation. Furthermore, we propose a manifold-based
  training strategy that allows effective disentangling, meaning that units in each
  group encode a distinct type of variation. Our model achieves state-of-the-art emotion
  recognition and face verification performance on the Toronto Face Database, and
  we also demonstrate disentangled features learned on the CMU Multi-PIE dataset.
