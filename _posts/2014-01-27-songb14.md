title: On learning to localize objects with minimal supervision
abstract: Learning to localize objects with minimal supervision is an important problem
  in computer vision, since large fully annotated datasets are extremely costly to
  obtain. In this paper, we propose a new method that achieves this goal with only
  image-level labels of whether the objects are present or not. Our approach combines
  a discriminative submodular cover problem for automatically discovering a set of
  positive object windows with a smoothed latent SVM formulation. The latter allows
  us to leverage efficient quasi-Newton optimization techniques. Our experiments demonstrate
  that the proposed approach provides a 50% relative improvement in mean average precision
  over the current state-of-the-art on PASCAL VOC 2007 detection.
