title: Robust Distance Metric Learning via Simultaneous L1-Norm Minimization and Maximization
abstract: Traditional distance metric learning with side information usually formulates
  the objectives using the covariance matrices of the data point pairs in the two
  constraint sets of must-links and cannot-links. Because the covariance matrix computes
  the sum of the squared L2-norm distances, it is prone to both outlier samples and
  outlier features. To develop a robust distance metric learning method, in this paper
  we propose a new objective for distance metric learning using the L1-norm distances.
  However, the resulted objective is very challenging to solve, because it simultaneously
  minimizes and maximizes (minmax) a number of non-smooth L1-norm terms. As an important
  theoretical contribution of this paper, we systematically derive an efficient iterative
  algorithm to solve the general L1-norm minmax problem, which is rarely studied in
  literature. We have performed extensive empirical evaluations, where our new distance
  metric learning method outperforms related state-of-the-art methods in a variety
  of experimental settings to cluster both noiseless and noisy data.
