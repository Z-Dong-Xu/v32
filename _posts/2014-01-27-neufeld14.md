title: Adaptive Monte Carlo via Bandit Allocation
abstract: We consider the problem of sequentially choosing between a set of unbiased
  Monte Carlo estimators to minimize the mean-squared-error (MSE) of a final combined
  estimate. By reducing this task to a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, we show
  that well developed allocation strategies can be used to achieve an MSE that approaches
  that of the best estimator chosen in retrospect. We then extend these developments
  to a scenario where alternative estimators have different, possibly stochastic,
  costs. The outcome is a new set of adaptive Monte Carlo strategies that provide
  stronger guarantees than previous approaches while offering practical advantages.
