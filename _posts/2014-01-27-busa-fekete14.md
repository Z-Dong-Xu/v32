title: 'Preference-Based Rank Elicitation using Statistical Models: The Case of Mallows'
abstract: We address the problem of rank elicitation assuming that the underlying
  data generating process is characterized by a probability distribution on the set
  of all rankings (total orders) of a given set of items. Instead of asking for complete
  rankings, however, our learner is only allowed to query pairwise preferences. Using
  information of that kind, the goal of the learner is to reliably predict properties
  of the distribution, such as the most probable top-item, the most probable ranking,
  or the distribution itself. More specifically, learning is done in an online manner,
  and the goal is to minimize sample complexity while guaranteeing a certain level
  of confidence.
