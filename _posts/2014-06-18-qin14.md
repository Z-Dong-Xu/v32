title: Sparse Reinforcement Learning via Convex Optimization
abstract: We propose two new algorithms for the sparse reinforcement learning problem
  based on different formulations.  The first algorithm is an off-line method based
  on the alternating direction method of multipliers for solving a constrained formulation
  that explicitly controls the projected Bellman residual.  The second algorithm is
  an online stochastic approximation algorithm that employs the regularized dual averaging
  technique, using the Lagrangian formulation.  The convergence of both algorithms
  are established. We demonstrate the performance of these algorithms through two
  classical examples.
