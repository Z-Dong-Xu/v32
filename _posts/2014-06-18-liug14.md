title: Learnability of the Superset Label Learning Problem
abstract: In the Superset Label Learning (SLL) problem, weak supervision is  provided
  in the form of a \it superset of labels that contains the  true label.  If the classifier
  predicts a label outside of the  superset, it commits a \it superset error.  Most
  existing SLL  algorithms learn a multiclass classifier by minimizing the superset  error.
  However, only limited theoretical analysis has been dedicated  to this approach.
  In this paper, we analyze Empirical Risk Minimizing  learners that use the superset
  error as the empirical risk measure.  SLL data can arise either in the form of independent
  instances or as  multiple-instance bags. For both scenarios, we give the conditions
  for  ERM learnability and sample complexity for the realizable case.
