title: Latent Variable Copula Inference for Bundle Pricing from Retail Transaction
  Data
abstract: Bundle discounts are used by retailers in many industries. Optimal bundle
  pricing requires learning the joint distribution of consumer valuations for the
  items in the bundle, that is, how much they are willing to pay for each of the items.
  We suppose that a retailer has sales transaction data, and the corresponding consumer
  valuations are latent variables. We develop a statistically consistent and computationally
  tractable inference procedure for fitting a copula model over correlated valuations,
  using only sales transaction data for the individual items. Simulations and data
  experiments demonstrate consistency, scalability, and the importance of incorporating
  correlations in the joint distribution.
