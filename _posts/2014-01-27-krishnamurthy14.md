title: Nonparametric Estimation of Renyi Divergence and Friends
abstract: We consider nonparametric estimation of L_2, Renyi-αand Tsallis-αdivergences
  between continuous distributions. Our approach is to construct estimators for particular
  integral functionals of two densities and translate them into divergence estimators.
  For the integral functionals, our estimators are based on corrections of a preliminary
  plug-in estimator. We show that these estimators achieve the parametric convergence
  rate of n^-1/2 when the densities’ smoothness, s, are both at least d/4 where d
  is the dimension. We also derive minimax lower bounds for this problem which confirm
  that s > d/4 is necessary to achieve the n^-1/2 rate of convergence. We validate
  our theoretical guarantees with a number of simulations.
