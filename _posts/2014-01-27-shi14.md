title: Online Bayesian Passive-Aggressive Learning
abstract: Online Passive-Aggressive (PA) learning is an effective framework for performing
  max-margin online learning. But the deterministic formulation and estimated single
  large-margin model could limit its capability in discovering descriptive structures
  underlying complex data. This paper presents online Bayesian Passive-Aggressive
  (BayesPA) learning, which subsumes the online PA and extends naturally to incorporate
  latent variables and perform nonparametric Bayesian inference, thus providing great
  flexibility for explorative analysis. We apply BayesPA to topic modeling and derive
  efficient online learning algorithms for max-margin topic models. We further develop
  nonparametric methods to resolve the number of topics. Experimental results on real
  datasets show that our approaches significantly improve time efficiency while maintaining
  comparable results with the batch counterparts.
