title: A new Q(lambda) with interim forward view and Monte Carlo equivalence
abstract: Q-learning, the most popular of reinforcement learning algorithms, has always
  included an extension to eligibility traces to enable more rapid learning and improved
  asymptotic performance on non-Markov problems. The lambda parameter smoothly shifts
  on-policy algorithms such as TD(lambda) and Sarsa(lambda) from a pure bootstrapping
  form (lambda=0) to a pure Monte Carlo form (lambda=1). In off-policy algorithms,
  including Q(lambda), GQ(lambda), and off-policy LSTD(lambda), the lambda parameter
  is intended to play the same role, but does not; on every exploratory action these
  algorithms bootstrap regardless of the value of lambda, and as a result they fail
  to approximate Monte Carlo learning when lambda=1. It may seem that this is inevitable
  for any online off-policy algorithm; if updates are made on each step on which the
  target policy is followed, then how could just the right updates be ‘un-made’ upon
  deviation from the target policy? In this paper, we introduce a new version of Q(lambda)
  that does exactly that, without significantly increased algorithmic complexity.
  En route to our new Q(lambda), we introduce a new derivation technique based on
  the forward-view/backward-view analysis familiar from TD(lambda) but extended to
  apply at every time step rather than only at the end of episodes. We apply this
  technique to derive first a new off-policy version of TD(lambda), called PTD(lambda),
  and then our new Q(lambda), called PQ(lambda).
