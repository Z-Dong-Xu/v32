title: Efficient Label Propagation
abstract: Label propagation is a popular graph-based semi-supervised learning framework.   So
  as to obtain the optimal labeling scores, the label propagation algorithm requires
  an inverse matrix which incurs the high computational cost of O(n^3+cn^2), where
  n and c are the numbers of data points and labels, respectively.   This paper proposes
  an efficient label propagation algorithm that guarantees exactly the same labeling
  results as those yielded by optimal labeling scores.   The key to our approach is
  to iteratively compute lower and upper bounds of labeling scores to prune unnecessary
  score computations.   This idea significantly reduces the computational cost to
  O(cnt) where t is the average number of iterations for each label and t << n in
  practice.   Experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of our algorithm
  over existing label propagation methods.
