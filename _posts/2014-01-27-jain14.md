title: "(Near) Dimension Independent Risk Bounds for Differentially Private Learning"
abstract: 'In this paper, we study the problem of differentially private risk minimization
  where the goal is to provide differentially private algorithms that have small excess
  risk. In particular we address the following open problem: \emphIs it possible to
  design computationally efficient differentially private risk minimizers with  excess
  risk bounds that do not explicitly depend on dimensionality (p) and do not require  structural
  assumptions like restricted strong convexity?  In this paper, we answer the question
  in the affirmative for a variant of the well-known  \emphoutput and \emphobjective
  perturbation algorithms [Chaudhuri et al., 2011]. In particular, we show that  in
  generalized linear model, variants of both output and objective perturbation algorithms
  have no \em explicit dependence on p. Our results assume that the underlying loss
  function is a 1-Lipschitz convex function and we show that the excess risk depends
  only on  L_2 norm of the true risk minimizer and that of training points.  Next,
  we present a novel privacy preserving algorithm for risk minimization over simplex
  in the generalized linear model, where the loss function is  a doubly differentiable
  convex function. Assuming that the training points have bounded L_âˆž-norm, our algorithm
  provides risk bound that has only \em logarithmic dependence on p. We also apply
  our technique to the online learning setting and obtain a regret bound with similar
  logarithmic dependence on p. In contrast, the existing differentially private online
  learning methods incur O(\sqrtp)  dependence.'
