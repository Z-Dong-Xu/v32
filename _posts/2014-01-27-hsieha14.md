title: A Divide-and-Conquer Solver for Kernel Support Vector Machines
abstract: The kernel support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most widely used classification
  methods; however, the amount of computation required becomes the bottleneck when
  facing millions of samples. In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel divide-and-conquer
  solver for kernel SVMs (DC-SVM). In the division step, we partition the kernel SVM
  problem into smaller subproblems by clustering the data, so that each subproblem
  can be solved independently and efficiently. We show theoretically that the support
  vectors identified by the subproblem solution are likely to be support vectors of
  the entire kernel SVM problem, provided that the problem is partitioned appropriately
  by kernel clustering. In the conquer step, the local solutions from the subproblems
  are used to initialize a global coordinate descent solver, which converges quickly
  as suggested by our analysis. By extending this idea, we develop a multilevel Divide-and-Conquer
  SVM algorithm with adaptive clustering and early prediction strategy, which outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods in terms of training speed, testing accuracy, and memory
  usage. As an example, on the covtype dataset with half-a-million samples, DC-SVM
  is 7 times faster than LIBSVM in obtaining the exact SVM solution (to within 10^-6
  relative error) which achieves 96.15% prediction accuracy. Moreover, with our proposed
  early prediction strategy, DC-SVM achieves about 96% accuracy in only 12 minutes,
  which is more than 100 times faster than LIBSVM.
