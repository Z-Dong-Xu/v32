title: Learning Graphs with a Few Hubs
abstract: We consider the problem of recovering the graph structure of a “hub-networked”
  Ising model given iid samples, under high-dimensional settings, where number of
  nodes p could be potentially larger than the number of samples n. By a “hub-networked”
  graph, we mean a graph with a few “hub nodes” with very large degrees. State of
  the art estimators for Ising models have a sample complexity that scales polynomially
  with the maximum node-degree, and are thus ill-suited to recovering such graphs
  with a few hub nodes. Some recent proposals for specifically recovering hub graphical
  models do not come with theoretical guarantees, and even empirically provide limited
  improvements over vanilla Ising model estimators. Here, we show that under such
  low sample settings, instead of estimating “difficult” components such as hub-neighborhoods,
  we can use quantitative indicators of our inability to do so, and thereby identify
  hub-nodes. This simple procedure allows us to recover hub-networked graphs with
  very strong statistical guarantees even under very low sample settings.
