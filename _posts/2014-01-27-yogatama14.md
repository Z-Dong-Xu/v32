title: 'Making the Most of Bag of Words: Sentence Regularization with Alternating
  Direction Method of Multipliers'
abstract: In many high-dimensional learning problems, only some parts of an observation
  are important to the prediction task; for example, the cues to correctly categorizing
  a document may lie in a handful of its sentences. We introduce a learning algorithm
  that exploits this intuition by encoding it in a regularizer.  Specifically, we
  apply the sparse overlapping group lasso with one group for every bundle of features
  occurring together in a training-data sentence, leading to thousands to millions
  of overlapping groups. We show how to efficiently solve the resulting optimization
  challenge using the alternating directions method of multipliers.  We find that
  the resulting method significantly outperforms competitive baselines (standard ridge,
  lasso, and elastic net regularizers) on a suite of real-world text categorization
  problems.
