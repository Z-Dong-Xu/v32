title: Large-margin  Weakly Supervised Dimensionality Reduction
abstract: 'This paper  studies dimensionality reduction in a weakly supervised setting,
  in which the preference relationship between examples is indicated by weak cues.
  A novel framework is proposed that integrates two aspects of the large margin principle
  (angle and distance), which simultaneously encourage angle consistency between preference
  pairs and maximize the distance between examples in preference pairs. Two specific
  algorithms are developed: an alternating direction method to learn a linear transformation
  matrix and a gradient boosting technique to optimize a non-linear transformation
  directly in the function space. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed
  large margin optimization criteria can strengthen and improve the robustness and
  generalization performance of preference learning algorithms on the obtained low-dimensional
  subspace. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the significance
  of studying dimensionality reduction in the weakly supervised setting and the effectiveness
  of the proposed framework.'
