title: Fast Multi-stage Submodular Maximization
abstract: We introduce a new multi-stage algorithmic framework for submodular maximization.
  We are motivated by extremely large scale machine learning problems, where both
  storing the whole data for function evaluation and running the standard accelerated
  greedy algorithm are prohibitive. We propose a multi-stage framework (called MultGreed),
  where at each stage we apply an approximate greedy procedure to maximize surrogate
  submodular functions. The surrogates serve as proxies for a target submodular function
  but require less memory and are easy to evaluate. We theoretically analyze the performance
  guarantee of the multi-stage framework, and give examples on how to design instances
  of MultGreed for a broad range of natural submodular functions. We show that MultGreed  performs
  very close to the standard greedy algorithm, given appropriate surrogate functions,
  and argue how our framework can easily be integrated with distributive algorithms
  for optimization. We complement our theory by empirically evaluating on several
  real world problems, including data subset selection on millions of speech samples,
  where MultGreed yields at least a thousand times speedup and superior results over
  the state-of-the-art selection methods.
