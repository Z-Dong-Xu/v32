title: Improving offline evaluation of contextual bandit algorithms via bootstrapping
  techniques
abstract: 'In many recommendation applications such as news recommendation, the  items
  that can be recommended come and go at a very fast pace.  This  is a challenge for
  recommender systems (RS) to face this setting.  Online learning algorithms seem
  to be the most straight forward  solution. The contextual bandit framework was introduced
  for that very  purpose. In general the evaluation of a RS is a critical issue. Live  evaluation
  is often avoided due to the potential loss of revenue,  hence the need for offline
  evaluation methods. Two options are  available. Model based methods are biased by
  nature and are thus  difficult to trust when used alone. Data driven methods are
  therefore  what we consider here. Evaluating online learning algorithms with past  data
  is not simple but some methods exist in the  literature. Nonetheless their accuracy
  is not satisfactory mainly due  to their mechanism of data rejection that only allow
  the exploitation  of a small fraction of the data. We precisely address this issue
  in  this paper. After highlighting the limitations of the previous  methods, we
  present a new method, based on bootstrapping  techniques. This new method comes
  with two important improvements: it  is much more accurate and it provides a measure
  of quality of its  estimation. The latter is a highly desirable property in order
  to  minimize the risks entailed by putting online a RS for the first  time. We provide
  both theoretical and experimental proofs of its  superiority compared to state-of-the-art
  methods, as well as an  analysis of the convergence of the measure of quality.'
