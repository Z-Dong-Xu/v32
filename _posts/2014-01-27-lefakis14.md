title: Dynamic Programming Boosting for Discriminative Macro-Action Discovery
abstract: We consider the problem of automatic macro-action discovery in imitation
  learning, which we cast as one of change-point detection. Unlike prior work in change-point
  detection, the present work leverages discriminative learning algorithms. Our main
  contribution is a novel supervised learning algorithm which extends the classical
  Boosting framework by combining it with dynamic programming. The resulting process
  alternatively improves the performance of individual strong predictors and the estimated
  change-points in the training sequence. Empirical evaluation is presented for the
  proposed method on tasks where change-points arise naturally as part of a classification
  problem. Finally we show the applicability of the algorithm to macro-action discovery
  in imitation learning and demonstrate it allows us to solve complex image-based
  goal-planning problems with thousands of features.
