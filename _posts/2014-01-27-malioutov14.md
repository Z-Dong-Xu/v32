title: Convex Total Least Squares
abstract: "We study the total least squares (TLS) problem that generalizes least squares
  regression by allowing measurement errors in both dependent  and independent variables.
  TLS is  widely used in applied \ffields including computer  vision, system identifi\fcation
  and econometrics.  The special case when all dependent  and independent variables
  have the same  level of uncorrelated Gaussian noise, known  as ordinary TLS, can
  be solved by singular  value decomposition (SVD). However, SVD  cannot solve many
  important practical TLS  problems with realistic noise structure, such  as having
  varying measurement noise, known  structure on the errors, or large outliers requiring
  \ robust error-norms. To solve such  problems, we develop convex relaxation approaches
  \ for a general class of structured  TLS (STLS). We show both theoretically  and
  experimentally, that while the plain nuclear  norm relaxation incurs large approximation
  \ errors for STLS, the re-weighted nuclear  norm approach is very effective, and
  \ achieves better accuracy on challenging STLS  problems than popular non-convex
  solvers.  We describe a fast solution based on augmented  Lagrangian formulation,
  and apply  our approach to an important class of biological  problems that use population
  average  measurements to infer cell-type and  physiological-state specific expression
  levels  that are very hard to measure directly."
