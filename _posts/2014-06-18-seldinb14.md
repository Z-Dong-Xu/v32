title: One Practical Algorithm for Both Stochastic and Adversarial Bandits
abstract: We present an algorithm for multiarmed bandits that achieves almost optimal
  performance in both stochastic and adversarial regimes without prior knowledge about
  the nature of the environment. Our algorithm is based on augmentation of the EXP3
  algorithm with a new control lever in the form of exploration parameters that are
  tailored individually for each arm. The algorithm simultaneously applies the “old”
  control lever, the learning rate, to control the regret in the adversarial regime
  and the new control lever to detect and exploit gaps between the arm losses. This
  secures problem-dependent “logarithmic” regret when gaps are present without compromising
  on the worst-case performance guarantee in the adversarial regime. We show that
  the algorithm can exploit both the usual expected gaps between the arm losses in
  the stochastic regime and deterministic gaps between the arm losses in the adversarial
  regime. The algorithm retains “logarithmic” regret guarantee in the stochastic regime
  even when some observations are contaminated by an adversary, as long as on average
  the contamination does not reduce the gap by more than a half. Our results for the
  stochastic regime are supported by experimental validation.
