title: Time-Regularized Interrupting Options (TRIO)
abstract: High-level skills relieve planning algorithms from low-level details. But
  when the skills are poorly designed for the domain, the resulting plan may be severely
  suboptimal. Sutton et al. 1999 made an important step towards resolving this problem
  by introducing a rule that automatically improves a set of skills called options.
  This rule terminates an option early whenever switching to another option gives
  a higher value than continuing with the current option. However, they only analyzed
  the case where the improvement rule is applied once. We show conditions where this
  rule converges to the optimal set of options. A new Bellman-like operator that simultaneously
  improves the set of options is at the core of our analysis. One problem with the
  update rule is that it tends to favor lower-level skills. Therefore we introduce
  a regularization term that favors longer duration skills. Experimental results demonstrate
  that this approach can derive a good set of high-level skills even when the original
  set of skills cannot solve the problem.
