title: Computing Parametric Ranking Models via Rank-Breaking
abstract: Rank breaking is a methodology introduced by Azari Soufiani et al. (2013a)
  for applying a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) algorithm to the estimation of
  parametric ranking models. Breaking takes full rankings and breaks, or splits them
  up, into counts for pairs of alternatives that occur in particular positions (e.g.,
  first place and second place, second place and third place). GMMs are of interest
  because they can achieve significant speed-up relative to maximum likelihood approaches
  and comparable statistical efficiency. We characterize the breakings for which the
  estimator is consistent for random utility models (RUMs) including Plackett-Luce
  and Normal-RUM, develop a general sufficient condition for a full breaking to be
  the only consistent breaking, and provide a trichotomy theorem in regard to single-edge
  breakings. Experimental results are presented to show the computational efficiency
  along with statistical performance of the proposed method.
