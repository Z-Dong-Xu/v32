title: Large-Margin Metric Learning for Constrained Partitioning Problems
abstract: We consider unsupervised partitioning problems based explicitly or implicitly
  on the minimization of Euclidean distortions, such as clustering, image or video
  segmentation, and other change-point detection problems. We emphasize on cases with
  specific structure, which include many practical situations ranging from mean-based
  change-point detection to image segmentation problems. We aim at learning a Mahalanobis
  metric for these unsupervised problems, leading to feature weighting and/or selection.
  This is done in a supervised way by assuming the availability of several (partially)
  labeled datasets that share the same metric. We cast the metric learning problem
  as a large-margin structured prediction problem, with proper definition of regularizers
  and losses, leading to a convex optimization problem which can be solved efficiently.
  Our experiments show how learning the metric can significantly improve performance
  on bioinformatics, video  or image segmentation problems.
