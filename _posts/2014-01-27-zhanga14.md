title: Covering Number for Efficient Heuristic-based POMDP Planning
abstract: The difficulty of POMDP planning depends on the size of the search space
  involved. Heuristics are often used to reduce the search space size and improve
  computational efficiency; however, there are few theoretical bounds on their effectiveness.  In
  this paper, we use the covering number to characterize the size of the search space
  reachable under heuristics and  connect the complexity of POMDP planning to the
  effectiveness of heuristics. With insights from the theoretical analysis, we have
  developed  a practical POMDP algorithm, Packing-Guided Value Iteration (PGVI). Empirically,
  PGVI is competitive with the state-of-the-art point-based POMDP algorithms on 65
  small benchmark problems and outperforms them on 4 larger problems.
