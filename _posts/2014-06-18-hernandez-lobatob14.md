title: Probabilistic Matrix Factorization with Non-random Missing Data
abstract: We propose a probabilistic matrix factorization model for collaborative  filtering
  that learns from data that is missing not at random(MNAR). Matrix factorization
  models exhibit state-of-the-art predictive performance in collaborative filtering.
  However, these models usually assume that the data is missing at random (MAR), and
  this is rarely the case. For example, the data is not MAR if users rate items they
  like more than ones they dislike. When the MAR assumption is incorrect, inferences
  are biased and predictive performance can suffer. Therefore, we model both the generative
  process for the data and the missing data mechanism. By learning these two models
  jointly we obtain improved performance over state-of-the-art methods when predicting
  the ratings and when modeling the data observation process. We present the first
  viable MF model for MNAR data. Our results are promising and we expect that further
  research on NMAR models will yield large gains in collaborative  filtering.
