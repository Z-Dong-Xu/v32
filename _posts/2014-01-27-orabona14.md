title: On Measure Concentration of Random Maximum A-Posteriori Perturbations
abstract: The maximum a-posteriori (MAP) perturbation framework has emerged as a useful
  approach for inference and learning in high dimensional complex models.  By maximizing
  a randomly perturbed potential function, MAP perturbations generate unbiased samples
  from the Gibbs distribution.  Unfortunately, the computational cost of generating
  so many high-dimensional random variables can be prohibitive.  More efficient algorithms
  use sequential sampling strategies based on the expected value of low dimensional
  MAP perturbations. This paper develops new measure concentration inequalities that
  bound the number of samples needed to estimate such expected values. Applying the
  general result to MAP perturbations can yield a more efficient algorithm to approximate
  sampling from the Gibbs distribution.  The measure concentration result is of general
  interest and may be applicable to other areas involving Monte Carlo estimation of
  expectations.
