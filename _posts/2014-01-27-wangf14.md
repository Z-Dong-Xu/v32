title: Robust Inverse Covariance Estimation under Noisy Measurements
abstract: This paper proposes a robust method to estimate the inverse covariance under
  noisy measurements. The method is based on the estimation of each column in the
  inverse covariance matrix independently via robust regression, which enables parallelization.
  Different from previous linear programming based methods that cannot guarantee a
  positive semi-definite covariance matrix, our method adjusts the learned matrix
  to satisfy this condition, which further facilitates the tasks of forecasting future
  values. Experiments on time series prediction and classification under  noisy condition
  demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
