title: Learning Modular Structures from Network Data and Node Variables
abstract: A standard technique for understanding underlying dependency structures
  among a set of variables posits a shared conditional probability distribution for
  the variables measured on individuals within a group. This approach is often referred
  to as module networks, where individuals are represented by nodes in a network,
  groups are termed modules, and the focus is on estimating the network structure
  among modules. However, estimation solely from node-specific variables can lead
  to spurious dependencies, and unverifiable structural assumptions are often used
  for regularization.  Here, we propose an extended model that leverages direct observations
  about the network in addition to node-specific variables. By integrating complementary
  data types, we avoid the need for structural assumptions. We illustrate theoretical
  and practical significance of the model and develop a reversible-jump MCMC learning
  procedure for learning modules and model parameters. We demonstrate the method accuracy
  in predicting modular structures from synthetic data and capability to learn regulatory
  modules in the  Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene regulatory network.
