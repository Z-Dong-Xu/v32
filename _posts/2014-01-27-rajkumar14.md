title: A Statistical Convergence Perspective of Algorithms for Rank Aggregation from
  Pairwise Data
abstract: 'There has been much interest recently in the problem of rank aggregation
  from pairwise data. A natural question that arises is: under what sorts of statistical
  assumptions do various rank aggregation algorithms converge to an ‘optimal’ ranking?
  In this paper, we consider this question in a natural setting where pairwise comparisons
  are drawn randomly and independently from some underlying probability distribution.
  We first show that, under a ‘time-reversibility’ or Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) condition
  on the distribution generating the outcomes of the pairwise comparisons, the rank
  centrality (PageRank) and least squares (HodgeRank) algorithms both converge to
  an optimal ranking. Next, we show that a matrix version of the Borda count algorithm,
  and more surprisingly, an algorithm which performs maximal likelihood estimation
  under a BTL assumption, both converge to an optimal ranking under a ‘low-noise’
  condition that is strictly more general than BTL. Finally, we propose a new SVM-based
  algorithm for rank aggregation from pairwise data, and show that this converges
  to an optimal ranking under an even more general condition that we term ‘generalized
  low-noise’. In all cases, we provide explicit sample complexity bounds for exact
  recovery of an optimal ranking. Our experiments confirm our theoretical findings
  and help to shed light on the statistical behavior of various rank aggregation algorithms.'
