title: A Discriminative Latent Variable Model for Online Clustering
abstract: This paper presents a latent variable structured prediction model for discriminative
  supervised clustering of items called the Latent Left-linking Model (L3M). We present
  an online clustering algorithm for L3M based on a feature-based item similarity
  function. We provide a learning framework for estimating the similarity function
  and present a fast stochastic gradient-based learning technique. In our experiments
  on coreference resolution and document clustering, L3 M outperforms several existing
  online as well as batch supervised clustering techniques.
