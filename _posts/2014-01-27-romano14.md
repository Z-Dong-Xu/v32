title: 'Standardized Mutual Information for Clustering Comparisons: One Step Further
  in Adjustment for Chance'
abstract: Mutual information is a very popular measure for comparing clusterings.
  Previous work has shown that it is beneficial to make an adjustment for chance to
  this measure, by subtracting an expected value and normalizing via an upper bound.
  This yields the constant baseline property that enhances intuitiveness. In this
  paper, we argue that a further type of statistical adjustment for the mutual information
  is also beneficial - an adjustment to correct selection bias. This type of adjustment
  is useful when carrying out many clustering comparisons, to select one or more preferred
  clusterings. It reduces the tendency for the mutual information to choose clustering
  solutions i) with more clusters, or ii) induced on fewer data points, when compared
  to a reference one. We term our new adjusted measure the *standardized mutual information*.
  It requires computation of the variance of mutual information under a hypergeometric
  model of randomness, which is technically challenging. We derive an analytical formula
  for this variance and analyze its complexity. We then experimentally assess how
  our new measure can address selection bias and also increase interpretability. We
  recommend using the standardized mutual information when making multiple clustering
  comparisons in situations where the number of records is small compared to the number
  of clusters considered.
