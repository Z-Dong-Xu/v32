title: Optimal PAC Multiple Arm Identification with Applications to Crowdsourcing
abstract: We study the problem of selecting K arms with the highest expected rewards
  in a stochastic N-armed bandit game.  Instead of using existing evaluation metrics  (e.g.,  misidentification
  probability or the metric in EXPLORE-K), we propose to use the aggregate regret,
  which is defined as the gap between the average reward of the optimal solution and
  that of our solution. Besides being a natural metric by itself, we argue that in
  many applications, such as our motivating example from crowdsourcing, the aggregate
  regret bound is more suitable. We propose a new PAC algorithm, which,  with  probability
  at least 1-δ, identifies a set of K arms with regret at most ε. We provide the sample
  complexity bound of our algorithm. To complement, we establish the  lower bound
  and show that the sample complexity of our algorithm matches the lower bound. Finally,
  we report experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets, which demonstrates
  the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.
