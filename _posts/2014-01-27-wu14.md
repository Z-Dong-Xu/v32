title: Learning the Consistent Behavior of Common Users for Target Node Prediction
  across Social Networks
abstract: 'We study the target node prediction problem: given two social networks,
  identify those nodes/users from one network (called the source network) who are
  likely to join another (called the target network, with nodes called target nodes).
  Although this problem can be solved using existing techniques in the field of cross
  domain classification, we observe that in many real-world situations the cross-domain
  classifiers perform sub-optimally due to the heterogeneity between source and target
  networks that prevents the knowledge from being transferred. In this paper, we propose
  learning the consistent behavior of common users to help the knowledge transfer.
  We first present the Consistent Incidence Co-Factorization (CICF) for identifying
  the consistent users, i.e., common users that behave consistently across networks.
  Then we introduce the Domain-UnBiased (DUB) classifiers that transfer knowledge
  only through those consistent users. Extensive experiments are conducted and the
  results show that our proposal copes with heterogeneity and improves prediction
  accuracy.'
