title: Elementary Estimators for Sparse Covariance Matrices and other Structured Moments
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating distributional parameters that are
  expected values of given feature functions. We are interested in recovery under
  high-dimensional regimes, where the number of variables p is potentially larger
  than the number of samples n, and where we need to impose structural constraints
  upon the parameters. In a natural distributional setting for this problem, the feature
  functions comprise the sufficient statistics of an exponential family, so that the
  problem would entail estimating structured moments of exponential family distributions.
  A special case of the above involves estimating the covariance matrix of a random
  vector, and where the natural distributional setting would correspond to the multivariate
  Gaussian distribution. Unlike the inverse covariance estimation case, we show that
  the regularized MLEs for covariance estimation, as well as natural Dantzig variants,
  are \emphnon-convex, even when the regularization functions themselves are convex;
  with the same holding for the general structured moment case. We propose a class
  of elementary convex estimators, that in many cases are available in \emphclosed-form,
  for estimating general structured moments. We then provide a unified statistical
  analysis of our class of estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of
  our class of estimators on real-world climatology and biology datasets.
