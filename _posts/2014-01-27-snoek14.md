title: Input Warping for Bayesian Optimization of Non-Stationary Functions
abstract: Bayesian optimization has proven to be a highly effective methodology for
  the global optimization of unknown, expensive and multimodal functions.  The ability
  to accurately model distributions over functions is critical to the effectiveness
  of Bayesian optimization.  Although Gaussian processes provide a flexible prior
  over functions, there are various classes of functions that remain difficult to
  model.  One of the most frequently occurring of these is the class of non-stationary
  functions.  The optimization of the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms
  is a problem domain in which parameters are often manually transformed a priori,
  for example by optimizing in "log-space", to mitigate the effects of spatially-varying
  length scale.  We develop a methodology for automatically learning a wide family
  of bijective transformations or warpings of the input space using the Beta cumulative
  distribution function.  We further extend the warping framework to multi-task Bayesian
  optimization so that multiple tasks can be warped into a jointly stationary space.
  On a set of challenging benchmark optimization tasks, we observe that the inclusion
  of warping greatly improves on the state-of-the-art, producing better results faster
  and more reliably.
