title: Online Clustering of Bandits
abstract: We introduce a novel algorithmic approach to content recommendation based
  on adaptive clustering of exploration-exploitation (â€œbandit") strategies. We provide
  a sharp regret analysis of this algorithm in a standard stochastic noise setting,
  demonstrate its scalability properties, and prove its effectiveness on a number
  of artificial and real-world datasets. Our experiments show a significant increase
  in prediction performance over state-of-the-art methods for bandit problems.
