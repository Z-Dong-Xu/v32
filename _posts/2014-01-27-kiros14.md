title: Multimodal Neural Language Models
abstract: 'We introduce two multimodal neural language models: models of natural language
  that can be conditioned on other modalities. An image-text multimodal neural language
  model can be used to retrieve images given complex sentence queries, retrieve phrase
  descriptions given image queries, as well as generate text conditioned on images.
  We show that in the case of image-text modelling we can jointly learn word representations
  and image features by training our models together with a convolutional network.
  Unlike many of the existing methods, our approach can generate sentence descriptions
  for images without the use of templates, structured prediction, and/or syntactic
  trees. While we focus on image-text modelling, our algorithms can be easily applied
  to other modalities such as audio.'
