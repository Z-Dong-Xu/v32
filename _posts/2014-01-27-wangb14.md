title: A Highly Scalable Parallel Algorithm for Isotropic Total Variation Models
abstract: Total variation (TV) models are among the most popular and successful tools
  in signal processing. However, due to the complex nature of the TV term, it is challenging
  to efficiently compute a solution for large-scale problems. State-of-the-art algorithms
  that are based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)  often
  involve solving large-size linear systems. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable
  parallel algorithm for TV models that is based on a novel decomposition strategy
  of the problem domain. As a result, the TV models can be decoupled into a set of
  small and independent subproblems, which admit closed form solutions. This makes
  our approach particularly suitable for parallel implementation. Our algorithm is
  guaranteed to converge to its global minimum. With N variables and n_p processes,
  the time complexity is O(N/(Îµn_p)) to reach an epsilon-optimal solution. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art
  algorithms, especially in dealing with high-resolution, mega-size images.
