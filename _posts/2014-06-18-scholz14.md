title: A Physics-Based Model Prior for Object-Oriented MDPs
abstract: One of the key challenges in using reinforcement learning in robotics is
  the need for models that capture natural world structure. There are, methods that
  formalize multi-object dynamics using relational representations, but these methods
  are not sufficiently compact for  real-world robotics. We present a physics-based
  approach that exploits modern simulation tools to efficiently parameterize physical
  dynamics.  Our results show that this representation can result in much faster learning,
  by virtue of its strong but appropriate inductive bias in  physical environments.
