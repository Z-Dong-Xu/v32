title: Learning from Contagion (Without Timestamps)
abstract: We introduce and study new models for learning from contagion processes
  in a network. A learning algorithm is allowed to either choose or passively observe
  an initial set of seed infections. This seed set then induces a final set of infections
  resulting from the underlying stochastic contagion dynamics. Our models differ from
  prior work in that detailed vertex-by-vertex timestamps for the spread of the contagion
  are not observed. The goal of learning is to infer the unknown network structure.
  Our main theoretical results are efficient and provably correct algorithms for exactly
  learning trees. We provide empirical evidence that our algorithm performs well more
  generally on realistic sparse graphs.
