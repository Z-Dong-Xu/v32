title: 'Austerity in MCMC Land: Cutting the Metropolis-Hastings Budget'
abstract: Can we make Bayesian posterior MCMC sampling more efficient when faced with
  very large datasets? We argue that computing the likelihood for N datapoints in
  the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) test to reach a single binary decision is computationally
  inefficient. We introduce an approximate MH rule based on a sequential hypothesis
  test that allows us to accept or reject samples with high confidence using only
  a fraction of the data required for the exact MH rule. While this method introduces
  an asymptotic bias, we show that this bias can be controlled and is more than offset
  by a decrease in variance due to our ability to draw more samples per unit of time.
