title: Margins, Kernels and Non-linear Smoothed Perceptrons
abstract: We focus on the problem of finding a non-linear classification function
  that lies in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) both from the primal point
  of view (finding a perfect separator when one exists) and the dual point of view
  (giving a certificate of non-existence), with special focus on generalizations of
  two classical schemes - the Perceptron (primal) and Von-Neumann (dual) algorithms.   We
  cast our problem as one of maximizing the regularized normalized hard-margin (ρ)
  in an RKHS and use the Representer Theorem to  rephrase it in terms of a Mahalanobis
  dot-product/semi-norm associated with the kernel’s (normalized and signed) Gram
  matrix. We derive an accelerated smoothed algorithm with a convergence rate of \tfrac\sqrt
  \log nρ given n separable points, which is strikingly similar to the classical kernelized
  Perceptron algorithm whose rate is \tfrac1ρ^2. When no such classifier exists, we
  prove a version of Gordan’s separation theorem for RKHSs, and give a reinterpretation
  of negative margins. This allows us to give guarantees for a primal-dual algorithm
  that halts in \min{\tfrac\sqrt n|ρ|, \tfrac\sqrt nε} iterations with a perfect separator
  in the RKHS if the primal is feasible or a dual ε-certificate of near-infeasibility.
