title: 'Dual Query: Practical Private Query Release for High Dimensional Data'
abstract: We present a practical, differentially private algorithm for answering a
  large number of queries on high dimensional datasets. Like all algorithms for this
  task, ours necessarily has worst-case complexity exponential in the dimension of
  the data. However, our algorithm packages the computationally hard step into a concisely
  defined integer program, which can be solved non-privately using standard solvers.
  We prove accuracy and privacy theorems for our algorithm, and then demonstrate experimentally
  that our algorithm performs well in practice. For example,  our algorithm can efficiently
  and accurately answer millions of queries on the Netflix dataset, which has over
  17,000 attributes; this is an improvement on the state of the art by multiple orders
  of magnitude.
