title: Tracking Adversarial Targets
abstract: We study linear control problems with quadratic losses and adversarially
  chosen tracking targets. We present an efficient algorithm for this problem and
  show that, under standard conditions on the linear system, its regret with respect
  to an optimal linear policy grows as O(\log^2 T), where T is the number of rounds
  of the game.  We also study a problem with adversarially chosen transition dynamics;
  we present an exponentially-weighted average algorithm for this problem, and we
  give regret bounds that grow as O(\sqrt T).
