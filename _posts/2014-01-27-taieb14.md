title: Boosting multi-step autoregressive forecasts
abstract: Multi-step forecasts can be produced recursively by iterating a one-step
  model, or directly using a specific model for each horizon. Choosing between these
  two strategies is not an easy task since it involves a trade-off between bias and
  estimation variance over the forecast horizon. Using a nonlinear machine learning
  model makes the tradeoff even more difficult. To address this issue, we propose
  a new forecasting strategy which boosts traditional recursive linear forecasts with
  a direct strategy using a boosting autoregression procedure at each horizon. First,
  we investigate the performance of the proposed strategy in terms of bias and variance
  decomposition of the error using simulated time series. Then, we evaluate the proposed
  strategy on real-world time series from two forecasting competitions. Overall, we
  obtain excellent performance with respect to the standard forecasting strategies.
