title: Pitfalls in the use of Parallel Inference for the Dirichlet Process
abstract: "Recent work done by Lovell, Adams, and Mansingka (2012) and Williamson,
  Dubey, and Xing (2013) has suggested an alternative parametrisation for the Dirichlet
  process in order to derive non-approximate parallel MCMC inference for it \x96 work
  which has been picked-up and implemented in several different fields. In this paper
  we show that the approach suggested is impractical due to an extremely unbalanced
  distribution of the data. We characterise the requirements of efficient parallel
  inference for the Dirichlet process and show that the proposed inference fails most
  of these requirements (while approximate approaches often satisfy most of them).
  We present both theoretical and experimental evidence, analysing the load balance
  for the inference and showing that it is independent of the size of the dataset
  and the number of nodes available in the parallel implementation. We end with suggestions
  of alternative paths of research for efficient non-approximate parallel inference
  for the Dirichlet process."
