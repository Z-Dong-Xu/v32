title: Scalable Gaussian Process Structured Prediction for Grid Factor Graph Applications
abstract: Structured prediction is an important and well studied problem with many
  applications across machine learning. GPstruct is a recently proposed structured
  prediction model that offers appealing properties such as being kernelised, non-parametric,
  and supporting Bayesian inference (Brati√®res et al. 2013).   The model places a
  Gaussian process prior over energy functions which describe relationships between
  input variables and structured output variables.  However, the memory demand of
  GPstruct is quadratic in the number of latent variables and training runtime scales
  cubically.   This prevents GPstruct from being applied to problems involving grid
  factor graphs, which are prevalent in computer vision and spatial statistics applications.     Here
  we explore a scalable approach to learning GPstruct models based on ensemble learning,
  with weak learners (predictors) trained on subsets of the latent variables and bootstrap
  data, which can easily be distributed.  We show experiments with 4M latent variables
  on image segmentation.  Our method outperforms widely-used conditional random field
  models trained with pseudo-likelihood.   Moreover, in image segmentation problems
  it improves over recent state-of-the-art marginal optimisation methods in terms
  of predictive performance and uncertainty calibration. Finally, it generalises well
  on all training set sizes.
