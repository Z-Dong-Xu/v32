title: Coherent Matrix Completion
abstract: Matrix completion concerns the recovery of a low-rank matrix from a subset
  of its revealed entries, and nuclear norm minimization has emerged as an effective
  surrogate for this combinatorial problem.  Here, we show that nuclear norm minimization
  can recover an arbitrary n \times n matrix of rank r from O(nr log^2(n)) revealed
  entries, provided that revealed entries are drawn proportionally to the local row
  and column coherences (closely related to leverage scores) of the underlying matrix.  Our
  results are order-optimal up to logarithmic factors, and extend existing results
  for nuclear norm minimization which require strong incoherence conditions on the
  types of matrices that can be recovered, due to assumed uniformly distributed revealed
  entries.  We further provide extensive numerical evidence that a proposed two-phase
  sampling algorithm can perform nearly as well as local-coherence sampling and without
  requiring a priori knowledge of the matrix coherence structure.  Finally, we apply
  our results to quantify how weighted nuclear norm minimization can improve on unweighted
  minimization given an arbitrary set of sampled entries.
