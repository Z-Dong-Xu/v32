title: Two-Stage Metric Learning
abstract: In this paper, we present a novel two-stage metric learning algorithm. We
  first map each learning instance to a probability distribution by computing its
  similarities to a set of fixed anchor points. Then, we define the distance in the
  input data space as the Fisher information distance on the associated statistical
  manifold. This induces in the input data space a new family of distance metric which
  presents unique properties. Unlike kernelized metric learning, we do not require
  the similarity measure to be positive semi-definite. Moreover, it can also be interpreted
  as a local metric learning algorithm with well defined distance approximation. We
  evaluate its performance on a number of datasets. It outperforms significantly other
  metric learning methods and SVM.
