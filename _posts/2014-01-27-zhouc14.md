title: Aggregating  Ordinal Labels from Crowds by Minimax Conditional Entropy
abstract: We propose a method to aggregate noisy ordinal labels collected from a crowd
  of workers or annotators.  Eliciting ordinal labels is important in tasks such as
  judging web search quality and consumer satisfaction. Our method is  motivated by
  the observation that workers usually have difficulty distinguishing between two
  adjacent ordinal classes whereas distinguishing between two classes which are far
  away from each other is much easier. We develop the method  through  minimax conditional
  entropy subject to constraints which encode this observation. Empirical  evaluations
  on real datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods.
