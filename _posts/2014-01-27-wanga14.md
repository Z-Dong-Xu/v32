title: Rank-One Matrix Pursuit for Matrix Completion
abstract: Low rank matrix completion has been applied successfully in a wide range
  of machine learning applications, such as collaborative filtering, image inpainting
  and Microarray data imputation. However, many existing algorithms are not scalable
  to large-scale problems, as they involve computing singular value decomposition.
  In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable algorithm for matrix completion.
  The key idea is to extend the well-known orthogonal matching pursuit from the vector
  case to the matrix case. In each iteration, we pursue a rank-one matrix basis generated
  by the top singular vector pair of the current approximation residual and update
  the weights for all rank-one matrices obtained up to the current iteration. We further
  propose a novel weight updating rule to reduce the time and storage complexity,
  making the proposed algorithm scalable to large matrices. We establish the linear
  convergence of the proposed algorithm. The fast convergence is achieved due to the
  proposed construction of matrix bases and the estimation of the weights. We empirically
  evaluate the proposed algorithm on many real-world large scale datasets. Results
  show that our algorithm is much more efficient than state-of-the-art matrix completion
  algorithms while achieving similar or better prediction performance.
