title: Deterministic Anytime Inference for Stochastic Continuous-Time Markov Processes
abstract: We describe a deterministic anytime method for calculating  filtered and
  smoothed distributions in large variable-based continuous time  Markov processes.  Prior
  non-random algorithms do not converge to the true  distribution in the limit of
  infinite computation time.  Sampling  algorithms give different results each time
  run, which can lead to  instability when used inside expectation-maximization or
  other algorithms.  Our method combines the anytime convergent properties of sampling
  with the  non-random nature of variational approaches.  It is built upon a sum of  time-ordered
  products, an expansion of the matrix exponential.  We  demonstrate that our method
  performs as well as or better than the current  best sampling approaches on benchmark
  problems.
