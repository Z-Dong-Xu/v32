title: Putting MRFs on a Tensor Train
abstract: In the paper we present a new framework for dealing with probabilistic graphical
  models. Our approach relies on the recently proposed Tensor Train format (TT-format)
  of a tensor that while being  compact allows for efficient application of linear
  algebra operations. We present a way to convert the energy of a Markov random field
  to the TT-format and show how one can exploit the properties of the TT-format to
  attack the tasks of the partition function estimation and the MAP-inference. We
  provide theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of the proposed algorithm for estimating
  the partition function and compare our methods against several state-of-the-art
  algorithms.
