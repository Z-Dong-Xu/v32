title: Multivariate Maximal Correlation Analysis
abstract: Correlation analysis is one of the key elements of statistics, and has various
  applications in data analysis. Whereas most existing measures can only detect pairwise
  correlations between two dimensions, modern analysis aims at detecting correlations
  in multi-dimensional spaces.    We propose MAC, a novel multivariate correlation
  measure designed for discovering multi-dimensional patterns. It belongs to the powerful
  class of maximal correlation analysis, for which we propose a generalization to
  multivariate domains. We highlight the limitations of current methods in this class,
  and address these with MAC. Our experiments show that MAC outperforms existing solutions,
  is robust to noise, and discovers interesting and useful patterns.
