title: Learning the Irreducible Representations of Commutative Lie Groups
abstract: We present a new probabilistic model of compact commutative Lie groups that
  produces invariant-equivariant and disentangled representations of data. To define
  the notion of disentangling, we borrow a fundamental principle from physics that
  is used to derive the elementary particles of a system from its symmetries. Our
  model employs a newfound Bayesian conjugacy relation that enables fully tractable
  probabilistic inference over compact commutative Lie groups â€“ a class that includes
  the groups that describe the rotation and cyclic translation of images. We train
  the model on pairs of transformed image patches, and show that the learned invariant
  representation is highly effective for classification.
