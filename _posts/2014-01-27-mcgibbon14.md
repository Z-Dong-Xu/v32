title: Understanding Protein Dynamics with L1-Regularized Reversible Hidden Markov
  Models
abstract: 'We present a machine learning framework for modeling protein dynamics.
  Our  approach uses L1-regularized, reversible hidden Markov models to  understand
  large protein datasets generated via molecular dynamics  simulations. Our model
  is motivated by three design principles: (1) the requirement of massive scalability;
  (2) the need to adhere to relevant physical law; and (3) the necessity of providing
  accessible interpretations, critical for rational protein engineering and drug design.
  We present an EM algorithm for learning and introduce a model selection criteria
  based on the physical notion of relaxation timescales. We contrast our model with
  standard methods in biophysics and demonstrate improved robustness. We implement
  our algorithm on GPUs and apply the method to two large protein simulation datasets
  generated respectively on the NCSA Bluewaters supercomputer and the Folding@Home
  distributed computing network. Our analysis identifies the conformational dynamics
  of the ubiquitin protein responsible for signaling, and elucidates the stepwise
  activation mechanism of the c-Src kinase protein.'
