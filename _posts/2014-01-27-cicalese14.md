title: 'Diagnosis determination: decision trees optimizing simultaneously worst and
  expected testing cost'
abstract: In several applications of automatic diagnosis  and active learning a central
  problem is the evaluation of a discrete function by adaptively querying the values
  of its variables until the values read uniquely determine the value of the function.   In
  general reading the value of a variable is done at the expense of some cost (computational
  or possibly a fee to pay the corresponding experiment). The goal is to design a
  strategy for evaluating the function incurring little cost (in the worst case or
  in expectation according to a prior distribution on the possible variables’ assignments).  We
  provide an algorithm that builds a strategy (decision tree) with both expected cost
  and worst cost which are at most an O(\log n) factor away  from, respectively, the
  minimum possible expected cost and the minimum possible worst cost.  Our algorithm
  provides the best possible approximation simultaneously with respect to both criteria.
  In fact,  there is no algorithm that can guarantee o(\log n) approximation, under
  the assumption  that \cal P ≠\cal NP.
