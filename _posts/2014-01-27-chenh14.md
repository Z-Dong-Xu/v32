title: Weighted Graph Clustering with Non-Uniform Uncertainties
abstract: We study the graph clustering problem where each observation (edge or no-edge
  between a pair of nodes) may have a different level of confidence/uncertainty. We
  propose a clustering algorithm that is based on optimizing an appropriate weighted
  objective, where larger weights are given to observations with lower uncertainty.
  Our approach leads to a convex optimization problem that is efficiently solvable.
  We analyze our approach under a natural generative model, and establish theoretical
  guarantees for recovering the underlying clusters. Our main result is a general
  theorem that applies to any given weight and distribution for the uncertainty. By
  optimizing over the weights, we derive a provably optimal weighting scheme, which
  matches the information theoretic lower bound up to logarithmic factors and leads
  to strong performance bounds in several specific settings. By optimizing over the
  uncertainty distribution, we show that non-uniform uncertainties can actually help.
  In particular, if the graph is built by spending a limited amount of resource to
  take measurement on each node pair, then it is beneficial to allocate the resource
  in a non-uniform fashion to obtain accurate measurements on a few pairs of nodes,
  rather than obtaining inaccurate measurements on many pairs. We provide simulation
  results that validate our theoretical findings.
