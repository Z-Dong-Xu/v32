title: Linear Time Solver for Primal SVM
abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVM) is among the most popular classification techniques
  in machine learning, hence designing fast primal SVM algorithms for large-scale
  datasets is a hot topic in recent years. This paper presents a new L2-norm regularized
  primal SVM solver using Augmented Lagrange Multipliers, with linear-time computational
  cost for Lp-norm loss functions. The most computationally intensive steps (that
  determine the algorithmic complexity) of the proposed algorithm is purely and simply
  matrix-by-vector multiplication, which can be easily parallelized on a multi-core
  server for parallel computing. We implement and integrate our algorithm into the
  interfaces and framework of the well-known LibLinear software toolbox. Experiments
  show that our algorithm is with stable performance and on average faster than the
  state-of-the-art solvers such as SVMperf , Pegasos and the LibLinear that integrates
  the TRON, PCD and DCD algorithms.
