title: Thompson Sampling for Complex Online Problems
abstract: We consider stochastic multi-armed bandit problems with complex actions
  over a set of basic arms, where the decision maker plays a complex action rather
  than a basic arm in each round. The reward of the complex action is some function
  of the basic armsâ€™ rewards, and the feedback observed may not necessarily be the
  reward per-arm. For instance, when the complex actions are subsets of the arms,
  we may only observe the maximum reward over the chosen subset. Thus, feedback across
  complex actions may be coupled due to the nature of the reward function. We prove
  a frequentist regret bound for Thompson sampling in a very general setting involving
  parameter, action and observation spaces and a likelihood function over them. The
  bound holds for discretely-supported priors over the parameter space and without
  additional structural properties such as closed-form posteriors, conjugate prior
  structure or independence across arms. The regret bound scales logarithmically with
  time but, more importantly, with an improved constant that non-trivially captures
  the coupling across complex actions due to the structure of the rewards. As applications,
  we derive improved regret bounds for classes of complex bandit problems involving
  selecting subsets of arms, including the first nontrivial regret bounds for nonlinear
  MAX reward feedback from subsets. Using particle filters for computing posterior
  distributions which lack an explicit closed-form, we present numerical results for
  the performance of Thompson sampling for subset-selection and job scheduling problems.
