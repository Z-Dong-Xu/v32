title: Combinatorial Partial Monitoring Game with Linear Feedback and Its Applications
abstract: In online learning, a player chooses actions to play and receives reward
  and feedback from the environment with the goal of maximizing her reward over time.
  In this paper, we propose the model of combinatorial partial monitoring games with
  linear feedback, a model which simultaneously addresses limited feedback, infinite
  outcome space of the environment and exponentially large action space of the player.
  We present the Global Confidence Bound (GCB) algorithm, which integrates ideas from
  both combinatorial multi-armed bandits and finite partial monitoring games to handle
  all the above issues. GCB only requires feedback on a small set of actions and achieves
  O(T^\frac23\log T) distribution-independent regret and O(\log T) distribution-dependent
  regret (the latter assuming unique optimal action), where T is the total time steps
  played. Moreover, the regret bounds only depend linearly on \log |X| rather than
  |X|, where X is the action space. GCB isolates offline optimization tasks from online
  learning and avoids explicit enumeration of all actions in the online learning part.
  We demonstrate that our model and algorithm can be applied to a crowdsourcing application
  leading to both an efficient learning algorithm and low regret, and argue that they
  can be applied to a wide range of combinatorial applications constrained with limited
  feedback.
