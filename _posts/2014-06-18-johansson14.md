title: Global graph kernels using geometric embeddings
abstract: Applications of machine learning methods increasingly deal with graph structured
  data through kernels. Most existing graph kernels compare graphs in terms of features
  defined on small subgraphs such as walks, paths or graphlets, adopting an inherently
  local perspective. However, several interesting properties such as girth or chromatic
  number are global properties of the graph, and are not captured in local substructures.
  This paper presents two graph kernels defined on unlabeled graphs which capture
  global properties of graphs using the celebrated Lov√°sz number and its associated
  orthonormal representation. We make progress towards theoretical results aiding
  kernel choice, proving a result about the separation margin of our kernel for classes
  of graphs. We give empirical results on classification of synthesized graphs with
  important global properties as well as established benchmark graph datasets, showing
  that the accuracy of our kernels is better than or competitive to existing graph
  kernels.
