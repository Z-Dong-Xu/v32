title: Topic Modeling using Topics from Many Domains, Lifelong Learning and Big Data
abstract: Topic modeling has been commonly used to discover topics from document collections.
  However, unsupervised models can generate many incoherent topics. To address this
  problem, several knowledge-based topic models have been proposed to incorporate
  prior domain knowledge from the user. This work advances this research much further
  and shows that without any user input, we can mine the prior knowledge automatically
  and dynamically from topics already found from a large number of domains. This paper
  first proposes a novel method to mine such prior knowledge dynamically in the modeling
  process, and then a new topic model to use the knowledge to guide the model inference.
  What is also interesting is that this approach offers a novel lifelong learning
  algorithm for topic discovery, which exploits the big (past) data and knowledge
  gained from such data for subsequent modeling. Our experimental results using product
  reviews from 50 domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
