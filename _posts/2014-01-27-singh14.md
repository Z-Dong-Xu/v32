title: Generalized Exponential Concentration Inequality for Renyi Divergence Estimation
abstract: Estimating divergences between probability distributions in a consistent
  way is of great importance in many machine learning tasks. Although this is a fundamental
  problem in nonparametric statistics, to the best of our knowledge there has been
  no finite sample exponential inequality convergence bound derived for any divergence
  estimators. The main contribution of our work is to provide such a bound for an
  estimator of Renyi divergence for a smooth Holder class of densities on the d-dimensional
  unit cube. We also illustrate our theoretical results with a numerical experiment.
