title: 'Buffer k-d Trees: Processing Massive Nearest Neighbor Queries on GPUs'
abstract: We present a new approach for combining k-d trees and graphics processing
  units for nearest neighbor search. It is well known that a direct combination of
  these tools leads to a non-satisfying performance due to conditional computations
  and suboptimal memory accesses. To alleviate these problems, we propose a variant
  of the classical k-d tree data structure, called buffer k-d tree, which can be used
  to reorganize the search. Our experiments show that we can take advantage of both
  the hierarchical subdivision induced by k-d trees and the huge computational resources
  provided by todayâ€™s many-core devices. We demonstrate the potential of our approach
  in astronomy, where hundreds of million nearest neighbor queries have to be processed.
