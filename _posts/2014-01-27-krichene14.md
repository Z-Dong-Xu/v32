title: On the convergence of no-regret learning in selfish routing
abstract: We study the repeated, non-atomic routing game, in which selfish players
  make a sequence of routing decisions. We consider a model in which players use regret-minimizing
  algorithms as the learning mechanism, and study the resulting dynamics. We are concerned
  in particular with the convergence to the set of Nash equilibria of the routing
  game. No-regret learning algorithms are known to guarantee convergence of a subsequence
  of population strategies. We are concerned with convergence of the actual sequence.
  We show that convergence holds for a large class of online learning algorithms,
  inspired from the continuous-time replicator dynamics. In particular, the discounted
  Hedge algorithm is proved to belong to this class, which guarantees its convergence.
