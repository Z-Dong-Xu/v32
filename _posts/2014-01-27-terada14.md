title: Local Ordinal Embedding
abstract: 'We study the problem of ordinal embedding: given a set of ordinal constraints
  of the form distance(i,j) < distance(k,l) for some_quadruples (i,j,k,l) of indices,
  the goal is to construct a point configuration \hat\bmx_1, ..., \hat\bmx_n in \R^p
  that preserves these constraints as well as possible. Our first contribution is
  to suggest a simple new algorithm for this problem, Soft Ordinal Embedding. The
  key feature of the algorithm is that it recovers not only the ordinal constraints,
  but even the density structure of the underlying data set. As our second contribution
  we prove that in the large sample limit it is enough to know “local ordinal information”
  in order to perfectly reconstruct a given point configuration. This leads to our
  Local Ordinal Embedding algorithm, which can also be used for graph drawing.'
