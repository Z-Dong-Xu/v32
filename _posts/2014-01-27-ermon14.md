title: Low-density Parity Constraints for Hashing-Based Discrete Integration
abstract: In recent years, a number of probabilistic inference and counting techniques
  have been proposed that exploit pairwise independent hash functions to infer properties
  of succinctly defined high-dimensional sets. While providing desirable statistical
  guarantees, typical constructions of such hash functions are themselves not amenable
  to efficient inference. Inspired by the success of LDPC codes, we propose the use
  of low-density parity constraints to make inference more tractable in practice.
  While not strongly universal, we show that such sparse constraints belong to a new
  class of hash functions that we call Average Universal. These weaker hash functions
  retain the desirable statistical guarantees needed by most such probabilistic inference
  methods. Thus, they continue to provide provable accuracy guarantees while at the
  same time making a number of algorithms significantly more scalable in practice.
  Using this technique, we provide new, tighter bounds for challenging discrete integration
  and model counting problems.
