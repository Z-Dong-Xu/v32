title: Affinity Weighted Embedding
abstract: Supervised linear embedding models like Wsabie (Weston et al., 2011) and
  supervised semantic indexing (Bai et al., 2010) have proven successful at ranking,
  recommendation and annotation tasks. However, despite being scalable to large datasets
  they do not take full advantage of the extra data due to their linear nature, and
  we believe they typically underfit. We propose a new class of models which aim to
  provide improved performance while retaining many of the benefits of the existing
  class of embedding models. Our approach works by reweighting each component of the
  embedding of features and labels with a potentially nonlinear affinity function.
  We describe several variants of the family, and show  its usefulness on several
  datasets.
