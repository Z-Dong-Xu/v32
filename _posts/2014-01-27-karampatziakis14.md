title: Discriminative Features via Generalized Eigenvectors
abstract: Representing examples in a way that is compatible with the underlying classifier
  can greatly enhance the performance of a learning system. In this paper we investigate
  scalable techniques for inducing discriminative features by taking advantage of
  simple second order structure in the data. We focus on multiclass classification
  and show that features extracted from the generalized eigenvectors of the class
  conditional second moments lead to classifiers with excellent empirical performance.
  Moreover, these features have attractive theoretical properties, such as inducing
  representations that are invariant to linear transformations of the input. We evaluate
  classifiers built from these features on three different tasks, obtaining state
  of the art results.
