title: Programming by Feedback
abstract: 'This paper advocates a new ML-based programming framework, called Programming
  by Feedback (PF), which involves a sequence of interactions between the active computer
  and the user. The latter only provides preference judgments on pairs of solutions
  supplied by the active computer. The active computer involves two components: the
  learning component estimates the user’s utility function and accounts for the user’s  (possibly
  limited) competence; the optimization component explores the search space and returns
  the most appropriate candidate solution. A proof of principle of the approach is
  proposed, showing that PF requires a handful of interactions in order to solve some
  discrete and continuous benchmark problems.'
