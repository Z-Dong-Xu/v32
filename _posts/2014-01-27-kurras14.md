title: 'The f-Adjusted Graph Laplacian: a Diagonal Modification with a Geometric Interpretation'
abstract: Consider a neighborhood graph, for example a k-nearest neighbor graph, that
  is constructed on sample points drawn according to some density p. Our goal is to
  re-weight the graphâ€™s edges such that all cuts and volumes behave as if the graph
  was built on a different sample drawn from an alternative density q. We introduce
  the f-adjusted graph and prove that it provides the correct cuts and volumes as
  the sample size tends to infinity. From an algebraic perspective, we show that its
  normalized Laplacian, denoted as the f-adjusted Laplacian, represents a natural
  family of diagonal perturbations of the original normalized Laplacian. Our technique
  allows to apply any cut and volume based algorithm to the f-adjusted graph, for
  example spectral clustering, in order to study the given graph as if it were built
  on an unaccessible sample from a different density. We point out applications in
  sample bias correction, data uniformization, and multi-scale analysis of graphs.
