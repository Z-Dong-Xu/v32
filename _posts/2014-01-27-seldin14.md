title: Prediction with Limited Advice and Multiarmed Bandits with Paid Observations
abstract: We study two problems of online learning under restricted information access.
  In the first problem, \emphprediction with limited advice, we consider a game of
  prediction with expert advice, where on each round of the game we query the advice
  of a subset of M out of N experts. We present an algorithm that achieves O(\sqrt(N/M)T\ln
  N) regret on T rounds of this game. The second problem, the \emphmultiarmed bandit
  with paid  observations, is a variant of the adversarial N-armed bandit game, where
  on round t of the game we can observe the reward of any number of arms, but each
  observation has a cost c. We present an algorithm that achieves O((cN\ln N)^1/3
  T^2/3 + \sqrtT \ln N) regret on T rounds of this game in the worst case. Furthermore,
  we present a number of refinements that treat arm- and time-dependent observation
  costs and achieve lower regret under benign conditions. We present lower bounds
  that show that, apart from the logarithmic factors, the worst-case regret bounds
  cannot be improved.
