title: Scaling Up Robust MDPs using Function Approximation
abstract: 'We consider large-scale Markov decision processes (MDPs) with parameter
  uncertainty, under the robust MDP paradigm. Previous studies showed that robust
  MDPs, based on a minimax approach to handling uncertainty, can be solved using dynamic
  programming for small to medium sized problems. However, due to the "curse of dimensionality",
  MDPs that model real-life problems are typically prohibitively large for such approaches.
  In this work we employ a reinforcement learning approach to tackle this planning
  problem: we develop a robust approximate dynamic programming method based on a projected
  fixed point equation to approximately solve large scale robust MDPs. We show that
  the proposed method provably succeeds under certain technical conditions, and demonstrate
  its effectiveness through simulation of an option pricing problem. To the best of
  our knowledge, this is the first attempt to scale up the robust MDP paradigm.'
