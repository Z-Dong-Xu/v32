title: Probabilistic Partial Canonical Correlation Analysis
abstract: Partial canonical correlation analysis (partial CCA) is a statistical method
  that estimates a pair of linear projections onto a low dimensional space, where
  the correlation between two multidimensional variables is maximized after eliminating
  the influence of a third variable. Partial CCA is known to be closely related to
  a causality measure between two time series. However, partial CCA requires the inverses
  of covariance matrices, so the calculation is not stable. This is particularly the
  case for high-dimensional data or small sample sizes. Additionally, we cannot estimate
  the optimal dimension of the subspace in the model. In this paper, we have addressed
  these problems by proposing a probabilistic interpretation of partial CCA and deriving
  a Bayesian estimation method based on the probabilistic model. Our numerical experiments
  demonstrated that our methods can stably estimate the model parameters, even in
  high dimensions or when there are a small number of samples.
