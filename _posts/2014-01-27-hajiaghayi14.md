title: Efficient Continuous-Time Markov Chain Estimation
abstract: 'Many problems of practical interest rely on Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs)
  defined over combinatorial state spaces, rendering the computation of transition
  probabilities, and hence probabilistic inference, difficult or impossible with existing
  methods.  For problems with countably infinite states, where classical methods such
  as matrix exponentiation are not applicable,  the main alternative has been particle
  Markov chain Monte Carlo methods imputing both the holding times and sequences of
  visited states.    We propose a particle-based Monte Carlo approach where the holding
  times are marginalized analytically.  We demonstrate that in a range of realistic
  inferential setups, our scheme dramatically reduces the variance of the Monte Carlo
  approximation and yields more accurate parameter posterior approximations given
  a fixed computational budget. These experiments are performed on both synthetic
  and real datasets, drawing from two important examples of CTMCs having combinatorial
  state spaces: string-valued mutation models in phylogenetics and nucleic acid folding
  pathways.'
