title: 'Finito: A faster, permutable incremental gradient method for big data problems'
abstract: Recent advances in optimization theory have shown that smooth strongly convex
  finite sums can be minimized faster than by treating them as a black box "batch"
  problem. In this work we introduce a new method in this class with a theoretical
  convergence rate four times faster than existing methods, for sums with sufficiently
  many terms. This method is also amendable to a sampling without replacement scheme
  that in practice gives further speed-ups. We give empirical results showing state
  of the art performance.
