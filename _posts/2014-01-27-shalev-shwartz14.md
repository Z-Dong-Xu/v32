title: Accelerated Proximal Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent for Regularized Loss
  Minimization
abstract: We introduce a proximal version of the stochastic dual coordinate ascent
  method and show how to accelerate the method using an inner-outer iteration procedure.
  We analyze the runtime of the framework and obtain rates that improve state-of-the-art
  results for various key machine learning optimization problems including SVM,   logistic
  regression, ridge regression, Lasso, and multiclass SVM. Experiments validate our
  theoretical findings.
