title: Finding Dense Subgraphs via Low-Rank Bilinear Optimization
abstract: Given a graph, the Densest k-Subgraph (\DkS) problem asks for the subgraph
  on k vertices that contains the largest number of edges. In this work, we develop
  a novel algorithm for \DkS that searches a low-dimensional space for provably good
  solutions.  We obtain provable performance bounds that depend on the graph spectrum.  One
  of our results is that if there exists a k-subgraph that contains a constant fraction
  of all the edges, we can approximate \DkS within a factor arbitrarily close to two
  in polynomial time.     Our algorithm runs in nearly linear time, under spectral
  assumptions satisfied by   most graphs found in applications. Moreover, it is highly
  scalable and parallelizable.  We demonstrate this by implementing it in MapReduce
  and executing numerous experiments on  massive real-world graphs that have up to
  billions of edges.  We empirically show that our algorithm can find subgraphs of
  significantly higher density compared to the previous state of the art.
