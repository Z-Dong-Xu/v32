title: Geodesic Distance Function Learning via Heat Flow on Vector Fields
abstract: Learning a distance function or metric on a given data manifold is of great
  importance in machine learning and pattern recognition. Many of the previous works
  first embed the manifold to Euclidean space and then learn the distance function.
  However, such a scheme might not faithfully preserve the distance function if the
  original manifold is not Euclidean. In this paper, we propose to learn the distance
  function directly on the manifold without embedding. We first provide a theoretical
  characterization of the distance function by its gradient field. Based on our theoretical
  analysis, we propose to first learn the gradient field of the distance function
  and then learn the distance function itself. Specifically, we set the gradient field
  of a local distance function as an initial vector field. Then we transport it to
  the whole manifold via heat flow on vector fields. Finally, the geodesic distance
  function can be obtained by requiring its gradient field to be close to the normalized
  vector field. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.
