title: Scalable and Robust Bayesian Inference via the Median Posterior
abstract: Many Bayesian learning methods for massive data benefit from working with
  small subsets of observations.  In particular, significant progress has been made
  in scalable Bayesian learning via stochastic approximation.  However, Bayesian learning
  methods in distributed computing environments are often problem- or distribution-specific
  and use ad hoc techniques.   We propose a novel general approach to Bayesian inference
  that is scalable and robust to corruption in the data.  Our technique is based on
  the idea of splitting the data into several non-overlapping subgroups, evaluating
  the posterior distribution given each independent subgroup, and then combining the
  results.  The main novelty is the proposed aggregation step which is based on finding
  the geometric median of posterior distributions.    We present both theoretical
  and numerical results illustrating the advantages of our approach.
