title: 'Statistical-Computational Phase Transitions in Planted Models: The High-Dimensional
  Setting'
abstract: 'The planted models assume that a graph is generated from some unknown clusters
  by randomly placing edges between nodes according to their cluster memberships;
  the task is to recover the clusters given the graph. Special cases include planted
  clique, planted partition, planted densest subgraph and planted coloring. Of particular
  interest is the High-Dimensional setting where the number of clusters is allowed
  to grow with the number of nodes. We show that the space of model parameters can
  be partitioned into four disjoint regions corresponding to decreasing statistical
  and computational complexities: (1) the impossible regime, where all algorithms
  fail; (2) the hard regime, where the exponential-time Maximum Likelihood Estimator
  (MLE) succeeds, and no polynomial-time method is known; (3) the easy regime, where
  the polynomial-time convexified MLE succeeds; (4) the simple regime, where a simple
  counting/thresholding procedure succeeds. Moreover, each of these algorithms provably
  fails in the previous harder regimes. Our theorems establish the first minimax recovery
  results for the high-dimensional setting, and provide the best known guarantees
  for polynomial-time algorithms. Our results extend to the related problem of submatrix
  localization, a.k.a. bi-clustering. These results demonstrate the tradeoffs between
  statistical and computational considerations.'
