title: Compact Random Feature Maps
abstract: Kernel approximation using randomized feature maps has recently gained a
  lot of interest. In this work, we identify that previous approaches for polynomial
  kernel approximation create maps that are rank deficient, and therefore do not utilize
  the capacity of the projected feature space effectively. To address this challenge,
  we propose compact random feature maps (CRAFTMaps) to approximate polynomial kernels
  more concisely and accurately. We prove the error bounds of CRAFTMaps demonstrating
  their superior kernel reconstruction performance compared to the previous approximation
  schemes. We show how structured random matrices can be used to efficiently generate
  CRAFTMaps, and present a single-pass algorithm using CRAFTMaps to learn non-linear
  multi-class classifiers. We present experiments on multiple standard data-sets with
  performance competitive with state-of-the-art results.
