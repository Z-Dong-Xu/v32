title: Bias in Natural Actor-Critic Algorithms
abstract: We show that several popular discounted reward natural actor-critics, including
  the popular NAC-LSTD and eNAC algorithms, do not generate unbiased estimates of
  the natural policy gradient as claimed. We derive the first unbiased discounted
  reward natural actor-critics using batch and iterative approaches to gradient estimation.
  We argue that the bias makes the existing algorithms more appropriate for the average
  reward setting. We also show that, when Sarsa(lambda) is guaranteed to converge
  to an optimal policy, the objective function used by natural actor-critics is concave,
  so policy gradient methods are guaranteed to converge to globally optimal policies
  as well.
