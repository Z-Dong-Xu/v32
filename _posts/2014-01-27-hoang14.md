title: Nonmyopic $\epsilon$-Bayes-Optimal Active Learning of Gaussian Processes
abstract: A fundamental issue in active learning of Gaussian processes is that of
  the exploration-exploitation trade-off. This paper presents a novel nonmyopic ε-Bayes-optimal
  active learning (ε-BAL) approach that jointly and naturally optimizes the trade-off.   In
  contrast, existing works have primarily developed myopic/greedy algorithms or performed
  exploration and exploitation separately. To perform active learning in real time,
  we then propose an anytime algorithm based on ε-BAL with performance guarantee and
  empirically demonstrate using synthetic and real-world datasets that, with limited
  budget, it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.
